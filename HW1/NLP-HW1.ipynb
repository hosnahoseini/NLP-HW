All hearts are filled with grief and horror at the hideous crime which has darkened our land, and the memory of the murdered President, his protracted sufferings, his unyielding fortitude, the example and achievements of his life, and the pathos of his death will forever illumine the pages of our history. For the fourth time the officer elected by the people and ordained by the Constitution to fill a vacancy so created is called to assume the Executive chair. The wisdom of our fathers, foreseeing even the most dire possibilities, made sure that the Government should never be imperiled because of the uncertainty of human life. Men may die, but the fabrics of our free institutions remain unshaken. No higher or more assuring proof could exist of the strength and permanence of popular government than the fact that though the chosen of the people be struck down his constitutional successor is peacefully installed without shock or strain except the sorrow which mourns the bereavement. All the noble aspirations of my lamented predecessor which found expression in his life, the measures devised and suggested during his brief Administration to correct abuses, to enforce economy, to advance prosperity, and to promote the general welfare, to Insure domestic security and maintain friendly and honorable relations with the nations of the earth, will be garnered in the hearts of the people; and it will be my earnest endeavor to profit, and to see that the nation shall profit, by his example and experience. Prosperity blesses our country. Our fiscal policy is fixed by law, is well grounded and generally approved. No threatening issue mars our foreign intercourse, and the wisdom, integrity, and thrift of our people may be trusted to continue undisturbed the present assured career of peace, tranquilly, and welfare. The gloom and anxiety which have enshrouded the country must make repose especially welcome now. No demand for speedy legislation has been heard; no adequate occasion is apparent for an unusual session of Congress. The Constitution defines the functions and powers of the executive as clearly as those of either of the other two departments of the Government, and he must answer for the just exercise of the discretion it permits and the performance of the duties it imposes. Summoned to these high duties and responsibilities and profoundly conscious of their magnitude and gravity, I assume the trust imposed by the Constitution, relying for aid on divine guidance and the virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of the American people\",\n          \"To the Senate of the United States: I have the satisfaction to communicate to the Senate the results of the negotiations recently had in this city with the British minister, special and extraordinary. These results comprise First. A treaty to settle and define the boundaries between the territories of the United States and the possessions of Her Britannic Majesty in North America, for the suppression of the African slave trade, and the surrender of criminals fugitive from justice in certain cases. Second. A correspondence on the subject of the interference of the colonial authorities of the British West Indies with American merchant vessels driven by stress of weather or carried by violence into the ports of those colonies. Third. A correspondence upon the subject of the attack and destruction of the steamboat Caroline. Fourth. A correspondence on the subject of impressment. If this treaty shall receive the approbation of the Senate, it will terminate a difference respecting boundary which has long subsisted between the two Governments, has been the subject of several ineffectual attempts at settlement, and has sometimes led to great irritation, not without danger of disturbing the existing peace. Both the United States and the States more immediately concerned have entertained no doubt of the validity of the American title to all the territory which has been in dispute, but that title was controverted and the Government of the United States had agreed to make the dispute a subject of arbitration. One arbitration had been actually had, but had failed to settle the controversy, and it was found at the commencement of last year that a correspondence had been in progress between the two Governments for a joint commission, with an ultimate reference to an umpire or arbitrator with authority to make a final decision. That correspondence, however, had been retarded by various occurrences, and had come to no definite result when the special mission of Lord Ashburton was announced. This movement on the part of England afforded in the judgment of the Executive a favorable opportunity for making an attempt to settle this long existing controversy by some agreement or treaty without further reference to arbitration. It seemed entirely proper that if this purpose were entertained consultation should be had with the authorities of the States of Maine and Massachusetts. Letters, therefore, of which copies are herewith communicated, were addressed to the governors of those States, suggesting that commissioners should be appointed by each of them, respectively, to repair to this city and confer with the authorities of this Government on a line by agreement or compromise, with its equivalents and compensations. This suggestion was met by both States in a spirit of candor and patriotism and promptly complied with. Four commissioners on the part of Maine and three on the part of Massachusetts, all persons of distinction and high character, were duly appointed and commissioned and lost no time in presenting themselves at the seat of the Government of the United States. These commissioners have been in correspondence with this Government during the period of the discussions; have enjoyed its confidence and freest communications; have aided the general object with their counsel and advice, and in the end have unanimously signified their assent to the line proposed in the treaty. Ordinarily it would be no easy task to reconcile and bring together such a variety of interests in a matter in itself difficult and perplexed, but the efforts of the Government in attempting to accomplish this desirable object have been seconded and sustained by a spirit of accommodation and conciliation on the part of the States concerned, to which much of the success of these efforts is to be ascribed. Connected with the settlement of the line of the northeastern boundary, so far as it respects the States of Maine and Massachusetts, is the continuation of that line along the highlands to the northwesternmost head of Connecticut River. Which of the sources of that stream is entitled to this character has been matter of controversy and of some interest to the State of New Hampshire. The King of the Netherlands decided the main branch to be the northwesternmost head of the Connecticut. This did not satisfy the claim of New Hampshire. The line agreed to in the present treaty follows the highlands to the head of Halls Stream and thence down that river, embracing the whole claim of New Hampshire and establishing her title to 100,000 acres of territory more than she would have had by the decision of the King of the Netherlands. By the treaty of 1783 the line is to proceed down the Connecticut River to the forty-fifth degree of north latitude, and thence west by that parallel till it strikes the St. Lawrence. Recent examinations having ascertained that the line heretofore received as the true line of latitude between those points was erroneous, and that the correction of this error would not only leave on the British side a considerable tract of territory heretofore supposed to belong to the States of Vermont and New York, but also Rouses Point, the site of a military work of the United States, it has been regarded as an object of importance not only to establish the rights and jurisdiction of those States up to the line to which they have been considered to extend, but also to comprehend Rouses Point within the territory of the United States. The relinquishment by the British Government of all the territory south of the line heretofore considered to be the true line has been obtained, and the consideration for this relinquishment is to inure by the provisions of the treaty to the States of Maine and Massachusetts. The line of boundary, then, from the source of the St. Croix to the St. Lawrence, so far as Maine and Massachusetts are concerned, is fixed by their own consent and for considerations satisfactory to them, the chief of these considerations being the privilege of transporting the lumber and agricultural products grown and raised in Maine on the waters of the St. Johns and its tributaries down that river to the ocean free from imposition or disability. The importance of this privilege, perpetual in its terms, to a country covered at present by pine forests of great value, and much of it capable hereafter of agricultural improvement, is not a matter upon which the opinion of intelligent men is likely to be divided. So far as New Hampshire is concerned, the treaty secures all that she requires, and New York and Vermont are quieted to the extent of their claim and occupation. The difference which would be made in the northern boundary of these two States by correcting the parallel of latitude may be seen on Tanner's maps ( 1836 ), new atlas, maps Nos. 6 and 9. From the intersection of the forty-fifth degree of north latitude with the St. Lawrence and along that river and the lakes to the water communication between Lake Huron and Lake Superior the line was definitively agreed on by the commissioners of the two Governments under the sixth article of the treaty of Ghent; but between this last-mentioned point and the Lake of the Woods the commissioners acting under the seventh article of that treaty found several matters of disagreement, and therefore made no joint report to their respective Governments. The first of these was Sugar Island, or St. Georges Island, lying in St. Marys River, or the water communication between Lakes Huron and Superior. By the present treaty this island is embraced in the territories of the United States. Both from soil and position it is regarded as of much value. Another matter of difference was the manner of extending the line from the point at which the commissioners arrived, north of Isle Royale, in Lake Superior, to the Lake of the Woods. The British commissioner insisted on proceeding to Fond du Lac, at the southwest angle of the lake, and thence by the river St. Louis to the Rainy Lake. The American commissioner supposed the true course to be to proceed by way of the Dog River. Attempts were made to compromise this difference, but without success. The details of these proceedings are found at length in the printed separate reports of the commissioners. From the imperfect knowledge of this remote country at the date of the treaty of peace, some of the descriptions in that treaty do not harmonize with its natural features as now ascertained. \\u201cLong Lake\\u201d is nowhere to be found under that name. There is reason for supposing, however, that the sheet of water intended by that name is the estuary at the mouth of Pigeon River. The present treaty therefore adopts that estuary and river, and afterwards pursues the usual route across the height of land by the various portages and small lakes till the line reaches Rainy Lake, from which the commissioners agreed on the extension of it to its termination in the northwest angle of the Lake of the Woods. The region of country on and near the shore of the lake between Pigeon River on the north and Fond du Lac and the river St. Louis on the south and west, considered valuable as a mineral region, is thus included within the United States. It embraces a territory of 4,000,000 acres northward of the claim set up by the British commissioner under the treaty of Ghent. From the height of land at the head of Pigeon River westerly to the Rainy Lake the country is understood to be of little value, being described by surveyors and marked on the map as a region of rock and water. From the northwest angle of the Lake of the Woods, which is found to be in latitude Coast 190 The 23 ' 55 \\u201cnorth, existing treaties require the line to be run due south to its intersection with the forty-fifth parallel, and thence along that parallel to the Rocky Mountains. After sundry informal communications with the British minister upon the subject of the claims of the two countries to territory west of the Rocky Mountains, so little probability was found to exist of coming to any agreement on that subject at present that it was not thought expedient to make it one of the subjects of formal negotiation to be entered upon between this Government and the British minister as part of his duties under his special mission. By the treaty of 1783 the line of division along the rivers and lakes from the place where the forty-fifth parallel of north latitude strikes the St. Lawrence to the outlet of Lake Superior is invariably to be drawn through the middle of such waters, and not through the middle of their main channels. Such a line, if extended according to the literal terms of the treaty, would, it is obvious, occasionally intersect islands. The manner in which the commissioners of the two Governments dealt with this difficult subject may be seen in their reports. But where the line thus following the middle of the river or water course did not meet with islands, yet it was liable sometimes to leave the only practicable navigable channel altogether on one side. The treaty made no provision for the common use of the waters by the citizens and subjects of both countries. It has happened, therefore, in a few instances that the use of the river in particular places would be greatly diminished to one party or the other if in fact there was not a choice in the use of channels and passages. Thus at the Long Sault, in the St. Lawrence- a dangerous passage, practicable only for boats the only safe run is between the Long Sault Islands and Barnharts Island ( all which belong to the United States ) on one side and the American shore on the other. On the other hand, by far the best passage for vessels of any depth of water from Lake Erie into the Detroit River is between Bois Blanc, a British island, and the Canadian shore. So again, there are several channels or passages, of different degrees of facility and usefulness, between the several islands in the river St. Clair at or near its entry into the lake of that name. In these three cases the treaty provides that all the several passages and channels shall be free and open to the use of the citizens and subjects of both parties. The treaty obligations subsisting between the two countries for the suppression of the African slave trade and the complaints made to this Government within the last three or four years, many of them but too well founded, of the visitation, seizure, and detention of American vessels on that coast by British cruisers could not but form a delicate and highly important part of the negotiations which have now been held. The early and prominent part which the Government of the United States has taken for the abolition of this unlawful and inhuman traffic is well known. By the tenth article of the treaty of Ghent it is declared that the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity and justice, and that both His Majesty and the United States are desirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire abolition; and it is thereby agreed that both the contracting parties shall use their best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object. The Government of the United States has by law declared the African slave trade piracy, and at its suggestion other nations have made similar enactments. It has not been wanting in honest and zealous efforts, made in conformity with the wishes of the whole country, to accomplish the entire abolition of the traffic in slaves upon the African coast, but these efforts and those of other countries directed to the same end have proved to a considerable degree unsuccessful. Treaties are known to have been entered into some years ago between England and France by which the former power, which usually maintains a large naval force on the African station, was authorized to seize and bring in for adjudication vessels found engaged in the slave trade under the French flag. It is known that in December last a treaty was signed in London by the representatives of England, France, Russia, Prussia, and Austria having for its professed object a strong and united effort of the five powers to put an end to the traffic. This treaty was not officially communicated to the Government of the United States, but its provisions and stipulations are supposed to be accurately known to the public. It is understood to be not yet ratified on the part of France. No application or request has been made to this Government to become party to this treaty, but the course it might take in regard to it has exalted no small degree of attention and discussion in Europe, as the principle upon which it is founded and the stipulations which it contains have caused warm animadversions and great political excitement. In my message at the commencement of the present session of Congress I endeavored to state the principles which this Government supports respecting the right of search and the immunity of flags. Desirous of maintaining those principles fully, at the same time that existing obligations should be fulfilled, I have thought it most consistent with the honor and dignity of the country that it should execute its own laws and perform its own obligations by its own means and its own power. The examination or visitation of the merchant vessels of one nation by the cruisers of another for any purpose except those known and acknowledged by the law of nations, under whatever restraints or regulations it may take place, may lead to dangerous results. It is far better by other means to supersede any supposed necessity or any motive for such examination or visit. Interference with a merchant vessel by an armed cruiser is always a delicate proceeding, apt to touch the point of national honor as well as to affect the interests of individuals. It has been thought, therefore, expedient, not only in accordance with the stipulations of the treaty of Ghent, but at the same time as removing all pretext on the part of others for violating the immunities of the American flag upon the seas, as they exist and are defined by the law of nations, to enter into the articles now submitted to the Senate. The treaty which I now submit to you proposes no alteration, mitigation, or, modification of the rules of the law of nations. It provides simply that each of the two Governments shall maintain on the coast of Africa a sufficient squadron to enforce separately and respectively the laws, rights, and obligations of the two countries for the suppression of the slave trade. Another consideration of great importance has recommended this mode of fulfilling the duties and obligations of the country. Our commerce along the western coast of Africa is extensive, and supposed to be increasing. There is reason to think that in many cases those engaged in it have met with interruptions and annoyances caused by the jealousy and instigation of rivals engaged in the same trade. Many complaints on this subject have reached the Government. A respectable naval force on the coast is the natural resort and security against further occurrences of this kind. The surrender to justice of persons who, having committed high crimes, seek an asylum in the territories of a neighboring nation would seem to be an act due to the cause of general justice and properly belonging to the present state of civilization and intercourse. The British Provinces of North America are separated from the States of the Union by a line of several thousand miles, and along portions of this line the amount of population on either side is quite considerable, while the passage of the boundary is always easy. Offenders against the law on the one side transfer themselves to the other. Sometimes, with great difficulty, they are brought to justice, but very often they wholly escape. A consciousness of immunity from the power of avoiding justice in this way instigates the unprincipled and reckless to the commission of offenses, and the peace and good neighborhood of the border are consequently often disturbed. In the case of offenders fleeing from Canada into the United States, the governors of States are often applied to for their surrender, and questions of a very embarrassing nature arise from these applications. It has been thought highly important, therefore, to provide for the whole case by a proper treaty stipulation. The article on the subject in the proposed treaty is carefully confined to such offenses as all mankind agree to regard as heinous and destructive of the security of life and property. In this careful and specific enumeration of crimes the object has been to exclude all political offenses or criminal charges arising from wars or intestine commotions. Treason, misprision of treason, libels, desertion from military service, and other offenses of similar character are excluded. And lest some unforeseen inconvenience or unexpected abuse should arise from the stipulation rendering its continuance in the opinion of one or both of the parties not longer desirable, it is left in the power of either to put an end to it at will. The destruction of the steamboat Caroline at Schlosser four or five years ago occasioned no small degree of excitement at the time, and became the subject of correspondence between the two Governments. That correspondence, having been suspended for a considerable period, was renewed in the spring of the last year, but no satisfactory result having been arrived at, it was thought proper, though the occurrence had ceased to be fresh and recent, not to omit attention to it on the present occasion. It has only been so far discussed in the correspondence now submitted as it was accomplished by a violation of the territory of the United States. The letter of the British minister, while he attempts to justify that violation upon the ground of a pressing and overruling necessity, admitting, nevertheless, that even if justifiable an apology was due for it, and accompanying this acknowledgment with assurances of the sacred regard of his Government for the inviolability of national territory, has seemed to me sufficient to warrant forbearance from any further remonstrance against what took place as an aggression on the soil and territory of the country. On the subject of the interference of the British authorities in the West Indies, a confident hope is entertained that the correspondence which has taken place, showing the grounds taken by this Government and the engagements entered into by the British minister, will be found such as to satisfy the just expectation of the people of the United States. The impressment of seamen from merchant vessels of this country by British cruisers, although not practiced in time of peace, and therefore not at present a productive cause of difference and irritation, has, nevertheless, hitherto been so prominent a topic of controversy and is so likely to bring on renewed contentions at the first breaking out of a European war that it has been thought the part of wisdom now to take it into serious and earnest consideration. The letter from the Secretary of State to the British minister explains the ground which the Government has assumed and the principles which it means to uphold. For the defense of these grounds and the maintenance of these principles the most perfect reliance is placed on the intelligence of the American people and on their firmness and patriotism in whatever touches the honor of the country or its great and essential interests. JOHN TYLER. ( The following are inserted because they pertain to the treaty transmitted with the message of President Tyler immediately preceding. ) DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, August 3, 1848. To the Senate of the United States: The Secretary of State has the honor to transmit to the Senate, in compliance with a resolution adopted by it on the 29th ultimo, a copy of the joint report of the commissioners under the treaty of Washington of August 9, 1842, together with a copy of the report of the American commissioner transmitting the same to the State Department. JAMES BUCHANAN. Mr. Smith to Mr. Buchanan. WASHINGTON, April 20, 1848. In presenting to you the joint report of the commissioners appointed under the treaty of Washington of August 9, 1842, to survey and mark the line of boundary between the United States and the British Provinces, which I have the honor herewith most respectfully to submit, I have to perform the painful duty of informing you that the maps of that line and of the adjacent country, which had been elaborately constructed by the scientific corps on the part of the United States, and contained upon 100 sheets of drawing paper of the largest size, together with the tables of the survey, have been destroyed by the conflagration of the building in which they were contained. This house had been occupied by Major James D. Graham, the head of the scientific corps and principal astronomer of the American commission, as his office until his departure for Mexico. All the maps, drawings, and tables had been completed and duly authenticated by the joint commissioners, and were ready to be deposited with their joint report under their hands and seals in the archives of this Government. Of this I had the honor to inform you in my letter of the 24th ultimo. I can hardly express the pain which this unfortunate event has occasioned me. But I can not perceive that any imputation of blame can properly be attached to any officer of the commission. The care and custody of all the work of the United States scientific corps were properly placed in charge of Major Graham, as the head of that corps, who had had the immediate direction and superintendence of it from the first organization of the commission. He required the maps and tables at his office for reference and revision in the progress of the astronomical work. Upon his departure for Mexico he placed Lieutenant A. W. Whipple in his rooms with an injunction to guard with the utmost care the valuable property of the commission. On the day after he left the city, and when for the first time informed of the fact, I called upon Lieutenant Whipple and requested him to have all the maps, drawings, and tables ready to be turned over to the State Department on the following day. On the 24th ultimo I acquainted you with that fact. No censure can possibly be attributed to Lieutenant Whipple, whose great care and attention to all his duties have been on all occasions highly distinguished. He escaped from the fire with scarcely an article of his dress, and his loss in money and clothing is at least $ 1,000. Major Graham has lost his valuable library, together with personal effects to a large amount. The fire was communicated from the basement of the house, and by no effort could anything be saved. There are tracings of the maps upon\\u201d tissue paper, \\u201cwithout the topography, in the State of Maine, but they are not signed by the commissioners. The field books of the engineers were, fortunately, not in Major Graham's office, and are preserved. Duplicates of the maps, duly authenticated, have been placed in the British archives at London, which, although they have not the topography of the country so fully laid down upon them as it was upon our own, represent with equal exactness the survey of the boundary itself. Should it be deemed expedient by this Government to procure copies of them, access to those archives for that purpose would undoubtedly be permitted, and the object accomplished at small expense, and when completed these copies could be authenticated by the joint commissioners in accordance with the provisions of the treaty. I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient and humble servant, ALBERT SMITH. Report of the Joint commission of boundary appointed under the treaty of Washington of August 9, 1842. The undersigned, commissioners appointed under the treaty of Washington to trace and mark the boundary, as directed by that treaty, between the British possessions in North America and the United States that is to say, James Buckhall Estcourt, lieutenant-colonel in the British army, appointed commissioner by Her Britannic Majesty, and Albert Smith, appointed commissioner by the President of the United States -having accomplished the duty assigned to them, do now, in accordance with the directions of the said treaty, submit the following report and the accompanying maps, jointly signed, to their respective Governments. In obedience to the terms of the treaty, the undersigned met at Bangor, in the State of Maine, on the 1st day of May, 1843, where they produced and verified the authority under which they each were respectively to act. They then adjourned, because the weather was not sufficiently open for taking the field, to the 1st of the following month ( June ), and agreed to meet again at that time at Houlton. Accordingly, they did meet at that place, and began their operations. It may be desirable to state at the outset that for the sake of convenience the whole line of boundary marked by the undersigned has been divided in the mention made of the different portions into the following grand divisions, viz:\\u201d North line, \\u201cfrom the source of the St. Croix to the intersection of the St. John.\\u201d River St. John, \\u201cfrom the intersection of the north line to the mouth of the St. Francis.\\u201d River St. Francis, \\u201cfrom its mouth to the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook.\\u201d Southwest line, \\u201cfrom the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook to the Northwest Branch of the St. John.\\u201d South line, \\u201cfrom the Northwest Branch to the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25 ' on the Southwest Branch.\\u201d Southwest Branch, \\u201cfrom the parallel Congress.\\u201d 6 25 ' to its source. \\u201cHighlands,\\u201d from the source of the Southwest Branch of the St. John to the source of Halls Stream. \\u201cHalls Streams\\u201d from its source to the intersection of the line of Valentine and Collins. \\u201cWest line,\\u201d from Halls Stream to the St. Lawrence near St. Regis, along the line of Valentine and Collins. To return to the narration of operations: The exploring line of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson, as directed by the treaty, was traced from the monument at the source of the St. Croix to the intersection of the St. John. The monument found at the source of the St. Croix, as described in the report of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson, and the course of their exploring line, was traced by blazes or marks upon the trees. An old line, cut out by the assistant surveyors of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson, was also found, which terminated about half a mile north of the South Branch of the Meduxnikeag, where, by records to which the undersigned referred, they ascertained that it had been abandoned because of its deviation from the exploring fine of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson. After the exploration and remarking of the north line it was cut out 30 feet wide. The same was afterwards done in all parts where the boundary passed through woodland. After thus opening the north line it was surveyed, and iron posts were erected at intervals to mark it. The general bearing of the line was rather to the west of the meridian of the monument at the source of the St. Croix. The precise line laid down by the undersigned was determined by successive courses, of which each was made to be as long as was convenient, provided it did not pass out of the opening of 30 feet. At each angle of deflection an iron monument was erected, and placed anglewise with the line. Other monuments were erected at the crossing of roads, rivers, and at every mile, commencing from the source of the St. Croix. Those which were not intended to mark angles of deflection were placed square with the line. At the intersection of the St. John by the north line the river is deep and broad. The boundary rims up the middle of the channel of the river, as indicated by the maps, dividing the islands as follows: No. 1. Ryan's Island United States. No. 2. King's Island United States. No. 3. Les Trois Isles United States. No. 4. La Septieme Isle United States. No. 5. Quissibis Great Britain. No. 6. La Grand Isle United States. No. 7. Thibideau's Islands United States. No. 8. Madawaska lslands Great Britain. No. 9. Joseph Michaud's three islands United States. No. 10. Pine Island Great Britain. No. 11. Baker's Turtle } Dagle's } islands Great Britain Fourth } Fifth } No. 12. Kennedy's Island Great Britain. No. 13. Crock's } Cranberry islands Great Britain. Gooseberry No. 14. Savage's Island United States. No. 15. Wheelock's Island - United States. No. 16. Caton's Island United States. No. 17. Honeywell's Island United States. No. 18. Savage and Johnson's Island United States. No. 19. Grew's Island United States. No. 20. Kendall's Island Great Britain. The islands were distributed to Great Britain or to the United States, as they were found to be on the fight or left of the deep channel. There was but one doubtful case, La Septieme Isle, and that was apportioned to the United States because the majority of the owners were ascertained to reside on the United States side of the river. Monuments were erected upon the islands, marking them for Great Britain or the United States, as the case may have been. After leaving the St. John the boundary enters the St. Francis, dividing the islands at the mouth of that river in the manner shown in the maps. It then runs up the St. Francis, through the middle of the lakes upon it, to the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook, the third large lake from the mouth of the river. At the outlet a large monument has been erected. In order to determine the point on the Northwest Branch to which the treaty directed that a straight line should be run from the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook, a survey of that stream was made, and also of the main St. John in the neighborhood of the mouth of the Northwest Branch, and a line was cut between the John and the point on the Northwest Branch ascertained by the survey to be miles in the nearest direction from it, and the distance was afterwards verified by chaining. It was ascertained also, in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, by a triangulation of the country toward the highlands dividing the waters of the St. Lawrence and of the St. John, that more than 7 miles intervened between the point selected on the Northwest Branch and the crest of the dividing ridge. A large iron monument was afterwards erected on the point thus selected, and the space around was cleared and sown with grass seed. It is a short distance below the outlet of Lake Ishaganalshegeck. The outlet of Lake Pohenagamook and the point on the Northwest Branch designated by the treaty having been thus ascertained and marked, in the spring of 1844 a straight line was run between them. Along that line, which passes entirely through forest, monuments were erected at every mile, at the crossings of the principal streams and rivers, and at the tops of those hills where a transit instrument had been set up to test the straightness of the line. As soon as the parallel of latitude Congress. \\u201c6 25 ' had been determined on the Southwest Branch, in the early part of the summer of 1844, a straight line was drawn from the boundary point on the Northwest Branch to a large monument erected on the left bank of the Southwest Branch where it is intersected by the parallel of latitude Congress.\\u201d 6 25: The line so drawn crosses the Southwest Branch once before it reaches the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25 ', and at about half a mile distance from that parallel. There also a large monument has been set up on the left bank. From the intersection of the parallel Congress. \\u201c6 25 ' the boundary ascends the Southwest Branch, passes through a lake near its head, and so up a small stream which falls into the lake from the west to the source of that stream, which has been selected as the source of the Southwest Branch. On the Southwest Branch there are two principal forks, at each of which two monuments have been erected, one on each bank of the river immediately above the forks and upon the branch established as the boundary. The maps point out their positions. At the mouth of the small stream selected as the source of the Southwest Branch a monument has been erected upon a delta formed by two small outlets. Above those outlets three other monuments have been placed at intervals upon the same stream. Upon the crest of the dividing ridge, very close to the source of the Southwest Branch, a large monument has been erected. It is the first point in the highlands, and from it the boundary runs along the crest in a southerly direction, passing near to the southeastern shore of the Portage Lake, and so on to a large monument erected on a small eminence on the east side of the Kennebec road. Thence it passes through a dwelling house called Tachereau's, which was standing there at the time the line was run; so, by a tortuous course, it runs to the top of Sandy Stream Mountain; thence, inclining to the southwest, it runs over Hog Back the First, as shown in the maps; thence toward Hog Back the Second, which it leaves on the north side. Further on, at the head of Leech Lake, there is a stream which divides its waters and flows both into Canada and into the United States. The boundary has been made to run up that stream a short distance from the fork where the waters divide to a second fork; thence between the streams which unite to form that fork, and then to ascend again the dividing ridge. A monument has been erected at the fork first mentioned, where the waters divide. As the boundary approaches the valley of Spider River it bends to the southeast, and, by a wide circuit over high and steep hills, it turns the head of Spider River; thence it bends to the northwest until it approaches within about 4 miles of Lake Megantic; thence it turns again south, having the valley of Arnolds River on the right and of Dead River on the left. It leaves Gasford Mountain in Canada, threads its way over very high ground between the head of Arnolds River and the tributaries of the Magalloway; inclines then to the north, so to the west, over very rocky, mountainous, and difficult country, leaving Gipps Peak in the United States, and turns by a sharp angle at Saddle Back to the south. After that it again inclines to the west, and then to the south, and again to the west, and passes the head of the Connecticut. About 3 miles and a half east of the head of the Connecticut there is a division of waters similar to that described near Leech Lake. The boundary runs down a stream from near its source to the fork where it divides, and then again follows the dividing ridge. The spot is noted on the map. After the boundary has passed the head of the Connecticut it runs to the northwest, descending into very low, swampy ground between the heads of Indian Stream and the tributaries of the St. Francis. Thus it passes on, bending again to the south of west, over a high hill, to the source of Halls Stream. Iron monuments have been erected at intervals along the highlands from the source of the Southwest Branch of the St. John to the source of Halls Stream, the position of each of which is shown upon the maps. From the source of Halls Stream the boundary descends that river, dividing the islands, which are, however, merely unimportant alluvial deposits, in the manner indicated by the maps until it reaches the intersection of that stream by the line formerly run by Valentine and Collins as the forty-fifth degree of north latitude. At that point a large monument has been erected on the right and a small one on the left bank of the stream. Monuments have also been erected along the bank of this stream, as indicated on the maps. The line of Valentine and Collins was explored and found by the blazes still remaining in the original forest. Upon cutting into those blazes it was seen that deep seated in the tree there was a scar, the surface of the original blaze, slightly decayed, and upon counting the rings ( which indicate each year's growth of the tree ) it was found that the blazes dated back to 1772, 1773, and 1774. The line of Valentine and Collins was run in 1771, 1772, 1773, and 1774. The coincidence of the dates of the blazes with those of the above line, confirmed by the testimony of the people of the country, satisfied the undersigned that the line they had found was that mentioned in the treaty. Along this portion of the boundary, which is known as the forty-fifth degree of Valentine and Collins, and which extends from Halls Stream to St. Regis, there are several interruptions to the blazes in those parts where clearings have been made, and there the authentic marks of the precise situation of the old line have been lost. In those cases the undersigned have drawn the boundary line straight from the original blazes on the one side of a clearing to the original blazes on the other side of the same clearing. It can not be positively stated that the line as it has been traced through those clearings precisely coincides with the old line, but the undersigned believe that it does not differ materially from it; nor have they had the means of determining a nearer or a surer approximation. Along this line, at every point of deflection, an iron monument has been erected; also at the crossing of rivers, lakes, and roads. Those which mark deflections are placed, as on the\\u201d north line, \\u201canglewise with the line; all the others are placed square with it. The maps show the position of each. On the eastern shore of Lake Memphremagog an astronomical station was established, and on a large flat rock of granite, which happened to lie between the astronomical station and the boundary, was cut the following inscription: Capt: Robinson. Ast: Station 422 feet north. British Boundary Meridian Line. Commission Boundary Line 595 feet south August, 1845. A mark was cut upon the stone, as indicated by the dot upon the meridian line above, from which these measurements were made. At Rouses Point a monument of wrought stone was set up at the intersection of the boundary by the meridian of the transit instrument used there by Major Graham, and an inscription was cut upon it stating the latitude and longitude, the names of the observer and his assistant, the names of the commissioners, and the territories divided. To mark the position of the instruments used at the following astronomical stations along the west line, two monuments within a few feet of each other have been erected at each station, and they have been placed on the boundary line due north or south of the instrument, as the case may have been. The stations are: Lake Memphremagog, Richford, John McCoy's, Trout River. The boundary along the west line, though very far from being a straight line, is generally about half a mile north of the true parallel of latitude Coast 190 The from Halls Stream to Rouses Point. At about 28 miles west of Rouses Point it, however, crosses that parallel to the south until it reaches Chateaugay River, where it bends northward, and, crossing the parallel again about 4 miles east of St. Regis, it strikes the St. Lawrence 151 feet north of Coast 190 The. At that point a large monument has been erected on the bank of the St. Lawrence. Two large monuments have also been erected, one on either side of the river Richelieu near Rouses Point. No marks of the old line were to be found about St. Regis. It was therefore agreed to run a line due west from the last blaze which should be found in the woods on the east side of St. Regis. That blaze occurred about 1 mile east of the St. Regis River. The maps, which exhibit the boundary on a scale of 4 inches to 1 statute mile, consist of 62 consecutive sheets of antiquarian paper as constructed by the British and of 61 as constructed by the American commission. A general map has also been constructed on a scale of 8 miles to 1 inch by the British and of 10 miles to 1 inch by the American commission, upon which the before mentioned sheets are represented. The following portions of the boundary have been laid down by the British commission, on detached maps, on a scale of 12 inches to 1 mile, which have been signed by both commissioners: Grand Falls of the St. John, including the intersection of that river by the north line; islands of the St. John; the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook; the turning point of the boundary on the Northwest Branch of the St. John; the intersection of the Southwest Branch by the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25 '; the source of the Southwest Branch; the source of Halls Stream; the intersection of Halls Stream by the west line; Rouses Point; St. Regis; Derby. But similar maps have not been prepared by the American commission, because during the interval between the finishing of the maps of the British commission and those of the American it was thought that the maps already constructed upon a scale of 4 inches to 1 mile represented the boundary with sufficient clearness and accuracy. The astronomical observations were begun at the Grand Falls early in June, 1843, and were carried up the St. John River to the Northwest Branch by a chain of stations, which, together with the results obtained, are tabulated in the appendix accompanying this report. From the valley of the St. John an astronomical connection was made with Quebec, and thence to Montreal, and so to Rouses Point. From Rouses Point a connection was obtained with Cambridge University, near Boston. The astronomical stations on the west line were: Intersection of Halls Stream by the west line, Lake Memphremagog, Richford, Rouses Point, John McCoy's, Trout River, St. Regis. Latitude was also obtained at an astronomical station established for the purpose at the head of the Connecticut. Volumes containing the astronomical observations of both commissions are herewith submitted. From them it will be observed that the results for absolute longitude obtained by the British and American astronomers do not agree. It being a difference in no way affecting the survey of the boundary line, the undersigned do not feel called upon to attempt to reconcile it. The data upon which those results are based may be seen in the volumes of observations accompanying this report. In the appendix will be found, in a tabular form, the following: An abstract of the survey of the boundary along the north line; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the southwest line; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the south line; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the highlands; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the west line; the position of the monuments erected on the Southwest Branch of the St. John and on Halls Stream; the distribution of the islands of the St. John and the monuments on them; the guide lines and offsets run by each commission for the survey of the highlands; the azimuths of verification for the survey of the highlands; the latitudes and longitudes obtained from the astronomical observations; the comparative 512,977,32677,044,257 The obtained, and the methods used for the purpose. Upon comparing the maps of the two commissions it will be seen that the American commission numbers two monuments more than the British. Those are to be found, one on the\\u201d Fourth Island, \\u201cin the river St. John, and the other on the highlands between the source of the Southwest Branch of the river St. John and the Kennebec road. On the maps of the British commission representing the\\u201d west line \\u201cthe name of the town of\\u201d Derby \\u201chas been improperly placed north of the line instead of south of it. Also, on the same maps the direction of Salmon River, near the western extremity of the\\u201d west line, \\u201chas been incorrectly laid down from the boundary line northward. A direction has been given to it northeasterly instead of northwesterly. The above two corrections the British commissioner is authorized to make on his maps after his return to England. To avoid unnecessary delay in making their joint report, the undersigned have attached their signatures to the maps, although the lettering of some of the astronomical stations upon the maps of the American commission, as well as the alterations before mentioned in the maps of the British commission, are yet to be made; but in the maps of both the boundary has been laid down accurately and definitively, and the undersigned engage that it shall not be altered in any respect. In conclusion the undersigned have the honor to report that the line of boundary described in the foregoing statement has been run, marked, and surveyed, and the accompanying maps faithfully constructed from that survey. The undersigned take leave to add that the most perfect harmony has subsisted between the two commissions from first to last, and that no differences have arisen between the undersigned in the execution of the duties intrusted to them. Signed and sealed in duplicate, at the city of Washington, this 28th day of June, A. D. 1847. J. B. BUCKNALL ESTCOURT, Lieutenant-Colonel, Her Britannic Majesty's Commissioner. ALBERT SMITH, United States Commissioner. NOTE. The astronomical computations of the American commission not being completed, and it being unnecessary to defer the signing of the report on that account, the American commissioner engages to transmit them, with any other papers or tables not yet finished, as soon as they shall be so, to the British commissioner, through the American minister resident in London, to whom, upon delivery of the documents, the British commissioner will give a receipt, to be transmitted to the American commissioner. J. B. BUCKNALL ESTCOURT, Lieutenant-Colonel, H. B. M. Commissioner of Boundary. ALBERT SMITH United States Commissioner\",\n          \"GREAT BRITAIN 'S DEPARTURE FROM THE GOLD STANDARD THE PRESIDENT. I have been asked by two of your members to discuss something of the British demonetization or departure from the gold standard. I can only do that by way of background. I can not make a public statement in the matter. I think you will understand that this situation has been pending for a good many months. There has been a large amount of British investment in the United States, and that amount, estimated by the Department of Commerce, aggregates something over $ 1,500 million. That is not flight of capital but steadily increasing expenditures here which naturally affects the exchanges. It has taken place not only in the past few months but for some years back. That, of course, has affected the problem of exchange. There has been some piling up of immediate cash in our banks from that quarter. The course resolved upon by the British Government creates some temporary dislocations in the international world, but they are due more to the confusion arising out of readjustment of quotations and values than in their effect on the values of either securities or commodities. The first effect of the decrease in the gold value of the pound is a rise in prices of commodities in Great Britain, at least in all international commodities where the price is made by international action, such as in wheat and other raw materials. There is involved a large amount of transaction based on the readjustment of those prices. A certain amount of confusion comes out of that, and the effect on our commodity markets has been a decrease in prices. There has been a rise in price in England in consequence and our prices are practically unchanged yesterday and today. The fact that the pound is taken off its fixed value of $ 4.86 is not the abandonment of the gold standard even for the pound; as international commerce revolves in these days all transactions will be measured in some gold value, whether in dollars, francs, gulden, or any other of the fixed gold currencies. No transaction can take place unless it has some basis of measurement of that character. It really means that the fixed gold standard has been abandoned and a variable standard adopted which may change momentarily. But in any event all values in international commerce are bound to revolve on gold values or some measuring stick in gold. It is more or less a case of abandoning a fixed standard and adopting a variable one so far as international commerce is concerned. The effect in England will undoubtedly be to increase exports, which amounts to price reduction compared with the standard of measurement in gold, and it should act as a stimulant and thus should increase employment and increase the demand again for raw materials. Obviously, it amounts to a reduction in standards of living temporarily in those commodities which are imported, of course raw materials, but wages and rank will lag behind. Production costs will be lower, and consequently, exports will be stimulated. The tendency also may be to decrease imports to some extent especially for highly competitive goods. On the export side, the effect is not going to be very material on the United States because there are comparatively small volume of British and American goods which are highly competitive in neutral markets. A study made some time ago of the Argentine showed that there were only about 10 percent of the exports of the United States to the Argentine and correspondingly 10 percent of the British exports to the Argentine that were competitive. We are exporting goods which we can peculiarly produce to the best advantage, and it might mean competition in respect to that small fraction over toward the neutral market. But it would not be any appreciable volume. There might be some decrease in imports into Great Britain, especially in luxuries, but our trade with Great Britain consists largely of raw materials and manufactured goods. If there is stimulation of British exports our exports would be more likely to increase than decrease. I mention that only to indicate that the effect of it is not as far-reaching as some people may think. On the financial side there are no consequential balances of American banks in England. They will always have sufficient of their own capital. So there are no losses there of any consequence at all. All together the action, no doubt necessary on the British side, is not, we feel, going to have any great effect in the United States. The probabilities are that it will considerably improve the situation in England, and we will benefit in the long run. In any event, when there is a question pending over the world's economic life, the actual realization of it is much less severe on us than is the constant possibility of it such as has been the case for the past 3 or 4 months. All together if we are going to have an important economic shift it is better to have it over than to have it hanging about. You will realize also that this is not the first time that the pound has been off the gold basis. I do not know of any nation in the world which manages to maintain through its national life the gold value of its currency. There was a long period in the United States after the Civil War when we certainly could not maintain it. The pound was off the gold basis from some point in the war to 3, 4, or 5 years afterwards, but gradually the economic situation readjusts itself. These things are temporary and go back again to their original position. And that is all I have today\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

It\\u2019s great to be back in Miami. And thank you, Esther. I told you our family has been, unfortunately, this considerable consumer of healthcare. Please all sit down. Of healthcare and I\\u2019ve learned from personal experience as my sons, my daughter, my wife, family has learned if there are any angels in heaven, they\\u2019re all nurses, male and female. Docs let you live and nurses make you want to live. I really mean it. They\\u2019re there at the tough times. And by the way, thank you for your service in the military, but also thank you for the beginning of this pandemic.\\nJoe Biden: (18:10)\\nBeing a surgical nurse wasn\\u2019t easy when there wasn\\u2019t the PPE available to all of you as you walked into those operating rooms and dealt with all the problems. I know my son-in-law\\u2019s a physician surgeon in Philadelphia and the stories at the beginning of this process, when we should have had everything available. So thank you not only for your skill and your courage, but your bravery and doing what you\\u2019ve done. And I want to thank you for the care dedication that you went on, all your fellow SEIU members, all your nurses that show up and struggle with illness or coping with the loss of a loved one in terrible times.\\nJoe Biden: (18:56)\\nSo many of you had to hold a phone to a patient\\u2019s ear to say goodbye to a family member because they couldn\\u2019t be there. They couldn\\u2019t see them in the hospital as they passed. Now, I want to thank Victoria, Victoria for sharing her family\\u2019s journey with us today. Victoria and I were talking a little bit earlier. I was in South Asia speaking with a president and he asked me what made America unique? And I said immigration because it\\u2019s the history of this country. And he looked at me funny. He said, why is that?\\nJoe Biden: (19:37)\\nAnd I said, because almost everybody who\\u2019s come here, other than those who came in chains 400 years ago came because they\\u2019re escaping something and it took enormous courage. I really mean this. Think about it, enormous courage to leave everything they knew, everything that was familiar, sometimes leaving family members to get on a boat, a plane, train, whatever the means was to be able to leave and start a new life. And to do that, you have to have optimism, courage. You have to be resilient. You have to be willing to believe you can make things change for the better.\\nJoe Biden: (20:17)\\nThat\\u2019s what\\u2019s built this country, immigration. We are, not figuratively, it\\u2019s a phrase used to not often fully appreciated, a nation of immigrants. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re the most unique and strongest nation in the world. It\\u2019s family like yours and Esther\\u2019s that have made this country what it is through the hard work and faith and perseverance. The richness and beauty of Miami is built from the connections of family, culture, values that we share with our friends throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. Earlier this afternoon, I visited Little Haiti.\\nJoe Biden: (20:53)\\nHad been some years since been there when the earthquake occurred and I came to deliver some assistance to the Haitian community, as well as making sure we had temporary protective status granted. It\\u2019s a cultural complex and now here at the site name for one of Cuba\\u2019s most celebrated poets and thinkers. This city is living proof of the incredible strength that we draw from families and communities from every culture choosing America. So thank you, Victoria, for choosing us and I\\u2019m really honored that you\\u2019re going to vote for me in your first election.\\nJoe Biden: (21:33)\\nI promise you I will not let you down. I promise you I will not let you down. And let me also say at the top, my prayers continue to be with the president and the first lady for their health and safety as they like so many American families are dealing with COVID-19. I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend. Now that he\\u2019s busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this, listen to the scientists, support masks, support a mask mandate nationwide, require a mask in every federal building and facility and interstate travel, urge every governor, mayor to do the same.\\nJoe Biden: (22:21)\\nWe know it saves lives. His administration just rejected a mask mandate for public transportation on Friday. The CIA came along and said, we need to be protected and they said, no. I believe that was wrong and not very rational experts say that universal masking could say between now and January 100,000 lives. Let me say that again. Between now and January, mandatory masking could save 100,000 lives. I backed that mandate months ago. He should back it now. Since the president entered the hospital on Friday, since Friday, more than 100,000 more people have been diagnosed with COVID.\\nJoe Biden: (23:19)\\nAnd this week, at least 5,000 more will die. Cases and deaths are climbing in many states. I hope the president\\u2019s recovery is swift and successful, but our nation\\u2019s covered crisis is far, far from over. Today, my prayers are with the families of the 210,000 Americans who died from the virus. All those families who got up this morning and there was an empty chair at the breakfast table, tonight, an empty chair at the dinner table where one should be, husband, wife, son, daughter, mother, father. And nearly 7.5 million Americans-\\nJoe Biden: (24:02)\\nAnd nearly 7.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus to date. This pandemic and economic collapse has hit the Hispanic communities, particularly hard. Nationally, the infection rate among Hispanics is almost three times higher than white, non Hispanics. More than 40,000 Hispanics have died from COVID-19, devastating families and close knit communities of loved ones. And here in Florida, where Hispanics make up about one quarter of the population, they make up 37% of the COVID deaths.\\nJoe Biden: (24:44)\\nNearly 3 million Hispanics are unemployed. If you break that down, that last data, unemployment for Hispanic women and Hispanic youth actually went up last month. One in three Hispanic, small business owners have taken a hit and many are likely to have to close permanently. Some economists are calling this what they call a K shaped recovery. It means those at the top, they keep going up, their income. But everyone from the middle and lower-income, it keeps going down, keeps getting worse. Means that essential workers, so many of whom are Hispanic, have sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern American history. Because while workers are struggling, this is a shocking statistic, but it\\u2019s true, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just since the COVID crisis they have made an additional $300 billion. The top 100 additional made an additional $300 billion. Everyone else though, they got the bottom half of that K, downward, a downward slide.\\nJoe Biden: (26:09)\\nYou\\u2019re left to figure out how you\\u2019re going to pay your bills, put food on the table, pay the rent, or if you\\u2019re lucky enough to own a home, will you have enough money to pay the mortgage? How to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids, because their school has gone remote. You\\u2019re asked to risk your neck if you can\\u2019t work from home, while the risk of COVID are mostly kept outside, because you\\u2019re one of our first responders, a union nurse like Ester or on an assembly line, or working in a customer service or tourism industry or at a checkout counter or police office, firefighter. I know this isn\\u2019t an easy time, but I also think this pandemic has just helped us rip off the blinders in this country as how inequitable so many things are. People didn\\u2019t even realize, and so now they\\u2019ve seen it.\\nJoe Biden: (27:16)\\nI truly believe we have a tremendous opportunity to turn this moment of crisis in a moment of great progress for the country. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019ve laid out a comprehensive agenda, not just to rebuild our communities, but to build them back, make bold investments in them so we can build back better than before the crisis.\\nJoe Biden: (27:40)\\nAn independent analysis, President talks about\\u2026 he loves talking about Wall Street. He never talks about Moody\\u2019s on wall street that pointed out, they did a detailed assessment of my economic plan and his. And here\\u2019s what Moody\\u2019s concluded. They projected my economic plan will create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more jobs in the president\\u2019s economic plan will in four years and $1 trillion more in growth than the president\\u2019s plan.\\nJoe Biden: (28:14)\\nAnd here\\u2019s how it works. I\\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. You won\\u2019t pay a penny more. I guarantee you. But I\\u2019m going to ask the big corporations and the super wealthy to begin to pay their fair share. It\\u2019s not punishment. It just about time you start paying your fair share. The money we raise from making sure they pay their fair share will allow me to invest it in working people on a growing middle class.\\nJoe Biden: (28:50)\\nWhen I announced I said I wanted to rebuild the backbone of this country. Working folks, the middle class. They weren\\u2019t built by wall street. It was built by labor. Advance racial equity across the economy to make sure everyone is included in the deal this time. We\\u2019re going to invest it in creating millions of good paying jobs, union jobs in manufacturing and technology, making sure our future is made in America. In infrastructure, building roads, bridges, highways, ports, and airports like I was able to do when I ran the Recovery Act for our administration, putting billions of dollars in the Port of Miami, creating so good, hard working people with good decent union jobs, able to accommodate the new supertankers coming through the canal, generating some stability.\\nJoe Biden: (29:50)\\nMy plan will make sure Hispanic communities benefit from hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, to fill the cracks in the sidewalks, install broadband, close the digital divide, create spaces to live, work, and play in safely.\\nJoe Biden: (30:07)\\nAnd clean energy. We upgrade 4 million buildings, weatherize 2 million homes. We\\u2019ll create, at least, the estimates are at least 1 million good paying jobs and save us millions and millions of barrels of oil. We\\u2019re going to meet the threat of climate change and invest in strengthening climate resilience, where we are already dealing with an existential threat of climate change. I don\\u2019t have to tell you in Miami, don\\u2019t have to tell you in South Florida or in my state, which has the lowest sea level, lowest degree of height from sea level than any state in the nation. Stronger, more frequent hurricanes, rising tides, flooding. And no matter where the president says, maybe you should consider dropping an atomic weapon on a hurricane coming our way is not a good idea. It doesn\\u2019t work. Look, that\\u2019s not some distant future in Miami or South Florida. You\\u2019re dealing with it right now. What do you have to do to get knocked in the head to understand it?\\nJoe Biden: (31:18)\\nWe\\u2019re going to make sure the small businesses could come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts. My plan will get $50 billion in capital flowing to small businesses, which would get repaid in employment and taxes, especially minority owned small businesses and make another $100 billion in low interest loans available to those businesses to get back on their feet and stay alive, because you know as well as I do, and ethnic communities, they are the heartbeat, they\\u2019re the center of a community. Whether it\\u2019s a grocery store, a beauty shop, the barbershop, the hardware store, the essence of a community. We\\u2019re going to make investments to increase incomes as well. It\\u2019s long past time. I\\u2019ve worked with Governor Cuomo to get it done in New York and other governors across the country. No one should have to work two jobs to be able to be 40 hours a week, so they\\u2019re above the poverty rate. $15 should be a minimum wage in the United States of America, period.\\nJoe Biden: (32:29)\\nAnd for our essential workers, we\\u2019re not just going to praise you, we\\u2019re going to begin to pay you a good wage, be sure you have strong benefits. We\\u2019re going to ease the burden of the major costs in your life. What are they? Healthcare. We\\u2019re going to build on the Affordable Care Act, which gave 4 million Hispanic people in this country health insurance, by adding a new health insurance option, a not for profit public option. We\\u2019re going to give private insurers a real competitor. We\\u2019re going to increase subsidies, so your premiums are lower and you can and afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses.\\nJoe Biden: (33:10)\\nWe\\u2019re going to take on the pharmaceutical industry, a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. You think I\\u2019m making these numbers up. If we just let Medicare negotiate independently for all the drugs they purchase, I promise you the rates are going to fall through the floor. Affordable and accessible.\\nJoe Biden: (33:33)\\nEvery three and four year old will have access to free quality preschool. All the studies at great universities and all the ones around the country have shown that no matter what zip code a child comes from, no matter what background, if they go to preschool, not daycare, preschool in school at three, four, and five years old, they increase exponentially, over by over 50% a prospect they\\u2019ll go through all 12 years and many beyond.\\nJoe Biden: (34:04)\\nAnd we\\u2019ll make sure, sure that low and middle-income\\u2026 and by the way, the total cost of that\\u2026 it\\u2019s called Title 1 program. We now spend $15 billion for in school districts that don\\u2019t have high tax rates. Well, guess what? You change that to 45. You can put every one of these kids in school, pay the teachers legitimate rate and make sure that you have school psychologists and social workers in those schools. We\\u2019re going to make sure that for childcare, for someone under the age of five or six, no one ever has to pay more than 7% of their income for their young children to get quality childcare, because you truly want to reward work in this country. We have to ease the financial burden of the care that families are carrying. Even before the pandemic, and many of you know it and many of you are doing it, millions of working families faced enormous financial and personal strains, trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability.\\nJoe Biden: (35:04)\\nIt\\u2019s going to sound strange, when I first got elected, when I was 29 years old to Senate, right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed. My two sons survived after hospitalized for a long time. I needed help do my job. I could not possibly afford childcare. Even though I was making a really good salary of $42,000 a year, more than I\\u2019d ever made. And I couldn\\u2019t afford it. Being a single mom or dad or a family that has two people working with young children, it\\u2019s incredibly costly. And by the way, and the professional caregivers out there, home health workers, childcare workers, were more often women, women of color and immigrants, and too often underpaid, unseen and undervalued. That\\u2019s why my build back better plan will elevate the compensation, benefits and dignity of caregiver-\\nJoe Biden: (36:03)\\n\\u2026 Back Better Plan will elevate the compensation benefits and dignity of caregivers and workers and early childhood educators. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re going to do. It\\u2019s also going to invest in education beyond high school. If you qualify to get into community college, you\\u2019ll automatically be able to go, and you\\u2019ll be able to go for free. If you are qualified to get into a four-year public school in your state public college, and your family makes less than $125, 000 a year, you get to go free. If you\\u2019re buying your first home, you\\u2019re going to have a tax credit up to $15,000 to get there. What happened after the Great Recession in this one? An awful lot of you range in age from the millennials have started off back after 9/11, all the way to the people graduating this year\\u2026 Are not in a position to do that, because your jobs have been postponed or non-existent. But providing an opportunity, I can get you into the system.\\nJoe Biden: (37:09)\\nWe\\u2019re also going to protect Social Security, increase the benefits for millions of seniors. We\\u2019re going to do that all in a partnership and lockstep with the Hispanic community. And by the way, the President\\u2019s proposal to eliminate the tax you pay when you get your paycheck for Social Security, without any means by which to replace it, the actuary at social security said Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023. They\\u2019ve never liked it to begin with. So look, success and prosperity of the Hispanic Americans is indispensable to the success and prosperity of the United States, and of all America. It\\u2019s that simple. Hispanic families are responsible today for $2.6 trillion of our gross domestic product, and growing. If that was a standalone economy, a country all by itself, it would be the eighth largest economy in the world. Think of that.\\nJoe Biden: (38:20)\\nNow imagine how much more that would grow if everyone had access to the tools they need to succeed. By investing in Hispanic communities, we\\u2019re making the smartest possible investment with the greatest possible returns that our nation could make, period. We also need to rebuild our ability to work with our partners throughout the Western hemisphere to realize the enormous potential of this region in the world, to confront those leaders who continue to oppress the rights of their people. We should be leading the international effort to confront the massive humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. Maduro, who I\\u2019ve met, is a dictator, plain and simple, and he\\u2019s causing incredible suffering among the Venezuelan people to maintain his grip on power. The Venezuelan people need our support to recover or their democracy and rebuild their country.\\nJoe Biden: (39:19)\\nThat\\u2019s why I would immediately grant temporary protective status to Venezuelans as President. So the Republicans in the Senate can\\u2019t keep blocking it like they did again just last week. I\\u2019ll make sure we\\u2019re supporting neighboring countries that are being overrun with immigration because of Maduro, like Columbia, which are caring for millions of Venezuelans who\\u2019ve fled their country in desperation. I\\u2019ll use sanctions as one of the tools for a comprehensive strategy that includes humanitarian assistance, international pressure, and support for democratic actors in Venezuela to force the regime to embark on the road to a free and fair election. We also need a new Cuba policy. The administration\\u2019s approach is not working. Cuba is no closer to freedom and democracy than it was four years ago. The fact there\\u2019s more political prisoners, the secret police are as brutal as ever, and Russia is once again a major presence in Cuba in Havana\\u2026 For my entire career, I strived for democracy and human rights, for freedom of the press, assembly and religion against dictators of the left and the right. As President, my policy will be governed by two principles.\\nJoe Biden: (40:40)\\nFirst, Americans, especially Cuban-Americans, are the best ambassadors for freedom in Cuba. Second, empowering the Cuban people to determine their own future is central to a national security interest in the United States. I think it\\u2019s unconscionable that the current administration is deporting hundreds of Cubans back to a dictatorship. There are almost 10,000 Cubans languishing in tent camps along the Mexican border because the administration\\u2019s anti-immigration agenda. That\\u2019s the administration actively separating Cuban families by not processing visas, through restrictions on family visits and remittances. I think we have to reverse that. The bottom line is that President Trump can not advance the democracy and human rights for the American people when he has embraced so many autocrats around the world, starting with Vladimir Putin.\\nJoe Biden: (41:40)\\nFolks, we can do this. We can reach for more as a nation. We can rebuild. We can rebuild the backbone of this country and finally bring everybody along. America\\u2019s always done best coming out of crisis. We\\u2019re the only nation it\\u2019s always come out of every crisis better than we went in. We can build a new administration that reflects the full diversity of our nation, including Hispanic communities. And Hispanic voters, especially in Florida, can help put our nation on a new path forward. And here in Florida today as the deadline to register to vote ends today\\u2026 If you haven\\u2019t registered, go out right now because it is an obligation. Every vote will make a difference. Check and make sure your family and friends are registered, and then make sure everyone has a plan to vote.\\nJoe Biden: (42:44)\\nIf you can vote by mail, vote by mail. If you can vote in person, vote in person, if you can vote early, vote early. You can vote early in person starting on October 19th in many places in Florida, including right here in Miami. Just make sure you vote. Together we can win. We can\\u2019t let this pandemic change everything. We\\u2019ve got to get it under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone. We can come together as a nation. I\\u2019m running as a Democrat. Proud of it, but I will be an American President, not a democratic President with a capital D. I\\u2019ll fight as hard for you and your family whether you vote for me or whether you vote against me because there\\u2019s nothing we can\\u2019t do when we do it together.\\nJoe Biden: (43:34)\\nFolks, I\\u2019ve been other more optimistic about our chances as a nation in the 21st century than I\\u2019ve been my whole career. There\\u2019s not a single solitary thing that\\u2019s beyond our capacities as a nation. I mean that sincerely. The most talented workers in the world\\u2026 We\\u2019re the most incredible system in the world. We have a people, who when they stand together, have never, ever, ever, ever failed. Every time I\\u2019d walk out of my grandpa\\u2019s house up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he\\u2019d yell, \\u201cJoey, keep the faith.\\u201d My grandma, when she was alive, would yell back, \\u201cNo, Joey, spread it.\\u201d Let\\u2019s go spread the faith. Take back this country. We\\u2019re so much better than this. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you.\\nJoe Biden: (44:34)\\n(music)\",\n          \"Speaker 1: (00:08)\\nFour more years! Four more years!\\nVice President Mike Pence : (00:55)\\nGood evening, America. It\\u2019s an honor to speak to you tonight from the hallowed grounds of Fort McHenry, the site of the very battle that inspired the words of our National Anthem. Those words have inspired this land of heroes in every generation since. It was on this site, 206 years ago, when our young Republic heroically withstood a ferocious Naval bombardment from the most powerful empire on earth. They came to crush our revolution, to divide our nation, and to end the American experiment. The heroes who held this Fort took their stand for life, liberty, freedom, and the American flag. And those ideals have defined our nation, but they were hardly ever mentioned at last week\\u2019s Democratic national convention. Instead, Democrats spent four days attacking America. Joe Biden said that we were living through a season of darkness, but as President Trump said, where Joe Biden sees American darkness, we see American greatness. In these challenging times, our country needs a President who believes in America, who believes in the boundless capacity of the American people, to meet any challenge, defeat any foe, and defend the freedoms we hold dear. America needs four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Before I go further, allow me to say a word to the families and communities in the path of Hurricane Laura. Our prayers are with you tonight and our administration is working closely with authorities in the states that will be impacted. FEMA has mobilized resources and supplies for those in harm\\u2019s way. This is a serious storm and we urge all those in the affected areas to heed state and local authorities. Stay safe and know that we\\u2019ll be with you every step of the way to support, rescue, respond and recover in the days and weeks ahead. That\\u2019s what Americans do.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (03:47)\\nFour years ago I answered the call to join this ticket because I knew that Donald Trump had the leadership and the vision to make America great again. And for the last four years, I\\u2019ve watched this President endure unrelenting attacks, but get up every day and fight to keep the promises that he made to the American people. So with gratitude for the confidence President Donald Trump has placed in me, the support of our Republican party, and the grace of God, I humbly accept your nomination to run and serve as Vice President of the United States. Serving the American people in this office has been a journey I never expected. It\\u2019s a journey that would not have been possible without the support of my family, beginning with my wonderful wife, Karen. She\\u2019s a lifelong school teacher, an incredible mother to our three children, and she is one outstanding Second Lady of the United States. I\\u2019m so proud of her. And we couldn\\u2019t be more proud of our three children, Marine Corps Captain Michael J. Pence and his wife, Sarah, our daughter, Charlotte Pence Bond, an author and the wife to Lieutenant Henry Bond who is currently deployed and serving our in the United States Navy, and our youngest, a recent law school grad, our daughter, Audrey and her fiance who like so many other Americans, had to delay their wedding this summer. But we can\\u2019t wait for Dan to be a part of our family.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (06:25)\\nIn addition, my wife and kids, the person who shaped my life the most is also with us tonight, my mom, Nancy. She is the daughter of an Irish immigrant, 87 years young, and mom follows politics very closely. And the truth be told, sometimes I think I\\u2019m actually her second favorite candidate on the Trump-Pence ticket. Thank you, mom. I love you.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (07:11)\\nOver the past four years, I\\u2019ve had the privilege to work closely with our President. I\\u2019ve seen him when the cameras are off. Americans see president Trump in lots of different ways, but there\\u2019s no doubt how President Trump sees America. He sees America for what it is: a nation that has done more good in this world than any other, a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance, and if you want a President who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted, he\\u2019s not your man. Now, we came by very different routes to this partnership. And some people think we\\u2019re a little bit different. But you know, I\\u2019ve learned a few things watching him, watching him deal with all that we\\u2019ve been through over the past four years. He does things in his own way, on his own terms. Not much gets past him. And when he has an opinion, he\\u2019s liable to share it. He certainly kept things interesting. But more importantly, President Donald Trump has kept his word to the American people. In a city known for talkers, President Trump is a doer, and few presidents have brought more independence, energy or determination to that office.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (09:02)\\nFour years ago, we inherited a military hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression, ISIS controlled a land mass twice the size of Pennsylvania, and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values: freedom of religion and the right to life. That\\u2019s when President Donald Trump stepped in. And from day one he kept his word. We rebuilt our military. This President signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan and created the first new branch of our armed forces in 70 years, the United States Space Force. And with that renewed energy, we also returned American astronauts to-\\nVice President Mike Pence : (10:03)\\nWith that renewed energy, we also returned American astronauts to space on an American rocket for the first time in nearly 10 years. After years of scandal, that robbed our veterans of the care that you earned in the uniform of the United States, president Trump kept his word again. We reformed the VA and Veterans Choice is now available for every veteran in America. Our armed forces and our veterans fill this land of heroes and many join us tonight in this historic fort. Tonight, we have among us four recipients of the Medal of Honor, six recipients of the Purple Heart, a Gold Star Mother of a gallant naval seaman, and wounded warriors from Soldier Strong, a group that serves our injured veterans every day. We are honored by your presence, and we thank you for your service.\\nCrowd: (11:25)\\nUSA. USA.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (11:48)\\nWith heroes, just like these, we defend this nation every day. Under this Commander In Chief, we\\u2019ve taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms, on their soil. Last year, American armed forces took the last inch of ISIS territory, crushed their caliphate and took down their leader without one American casualty. I was there when President Trump gave the order to take out the world\\u2019s most dangerous terrorist. Iran\\u2019s top general will never harm another American, because Qasem Soleimani is gone. My fellow Americans, you deserve to know, Joe Biden criticized President Trump, following those decisions, decisions to rid the world of two terrorist leaders.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (12:49)\\nBut it\\u2019s not surprising, because history records that Joe Biden even opposed the operation that took down Osama bin Laden. It\\u2019s no wonder that the Secretary of Defense, under the Obama-Biden administration once said, that Joe Biden has been, and I quote wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. We\\u2019ve stood up to her enemies and we\\u2019ve stood with our allies. Like when President Trump kept his word and moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel, setting the stage for the first Arab country to recognize Israel in 26 years.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (13:47)\\nCloser to home, we appointed more than 200 conservative judges to our federal courts. We supported the right to life and all the God given liberties enshrined in our constitution, including the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. When it came to the economy, President Trump kept his word and then some. We passed the largest tax cut and reform in American history. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration ever had. We unleashed American energy and fought for free and fair trade. In our first three years, businesses, large and small, created more than 7 million good- paying jobs, including 500,000 manufacturing jobs all across America.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (14:40)\\nOur country became a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. Unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans hit the lowest level ever recorded. OP this 100th anniversary of a woman\\u2019s right to vote, I\\u2019m proud to report that under president Donald Trump, we achieved the lowest unemployment rate for women in 65 years and more Americans working, than ever before. In our first three years, we built the greatest economy in the world. We made America great again. Then the coronavirus struck from China. Before the first case of the coronavirus spread within the United States, the president took unprecedented action and suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (15:46)\\nNow, that action saved untold American lives, and I can tell you firsthand, it bought us invaluable time to launch the greatest national mobilization since World War II. President Trump marshaled the full resources of our federal government from the outset. He directed us to forge a seamless partnership with governors across America, in both political parties. We partnered with private industry to reinvent testing and produce supplies that were distributed to hospitals around the land. Today, we\\u2019re conducting more than 800,000 tests a day, and we have coordinated the delivery of billions, of pieces of personal protective equipment for our amazing doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (16:46)\\nWe saw to the manufacturer of 100,000 ventilators in a hundred days, and no one who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator in the United States. We built hospitals, surged military medical personnel, and enacted an economic rescue package that saved 50 million American jobs. As we speak, we\\u2019re developing a growing number of treatments, known as therapeutics, including convalescent plasma that are saving lives all across America. Now, last week, Joe Biden said that no miracle is coming. But what Joe doesn\\u2019t seem to understand, is that America is a nation of miracles, and I\\u2019m proud to report that we\\u2019re on track to have the world\\u2019s first safe, effective coronavirus vaccine, by the end of this year. After all the sacrifice, in this year like no other, and all the hardship, we\\u2019re finding our way forward again. But tonight our hearts are with all the families that have lost loved ones and have family members still struggling with serious illness. In this country, we mourn with those who mourn. We grieve with those who grieve. This night, I know that millions of Americans will pause and pray for God\\u2019s comfort for each of you. Our country doesn\\u2019t get through such a time, unless it\\u2019s people find strength within. The response of doctors, nurses, first responders, farmers, factory workers, truckers, and everyday Americans who put the health and safety of their neighbors first, has been nothing short of heroic.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (19:13)\\nVeronica [Say as 00:09:16] put on her scrubs every day. Day in and day out, went to work in one of New York city\\u2019s busiest hospitals. She stayed on the job, put in the long hours until it was done, and then got back in her neighborhood and helped neighbors and friends struggling. Her brother, William is a New York City firefighter, and they\\u2019re both emblematic of heroes all across this country. They\\u2019re with us tonight. I say to them, and to all of you, you have earned the admiration of the American people, and we will always be grateful for your service and care.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (20:03)\\nAnd we will always be grateful for your service and care.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (20:18)\\nThanks to the courage and compassion of the American people, we\\u2019re slowing the spread, we\\u2019re protecting the vulnerable, and we\\u2019re saving lives and we\\u2019re opening up America again. Because of the strong foundation that President Trump poured in our first three years, we\\u2019ve already gained back 9.3 million jobs in the last three months alone. And we\\u2019re not just opening up America again, we\\u2019re opening up America\\u2019s schools and I\\u2019m proud to report that my wife Karen, that schoolteacher I\\u2019ve been married to, will be returning to her classroom next week and so to all of our heroic teachers and faculty and staff, thank you for being there for our kids. We\\u2019re going to stay with you every step of the way.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (21:37)\\nIn the days ahead as we open up America again, I promise you, we\\u2019ll continue to put the health of America first, and as we work to bring this economy back, we all have a role to play and we all have a choice to make. On November 3 you need to ask yourself, who do you trust to rebuild this economy? A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world? The choice is clear, to bring America all the way back, we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.\\nSpeaker 2: (22:37)\\nFour more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\\nVice President Mike Pence : (22:42)\\nMy fellow Americans, we\\u2019re passing through a time of testing, but in the midst of this global pandemic, just as our nation had begun to recover, we\\u2019ve seen violence and chaos in the streets of our major cities. President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest. But rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech and those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (23:23)\\nLast week, Joe Biden didn\\u2019t say one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across this country, so let me be clear. The violence must stop, whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha, too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see Americans strike each other down. We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color. President Trump and I know that the men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement are the best of us. Every day, when they walk out that door, they consider our lives more important than their own. People like Dave Patrick Underwood, an officer in the Department of Homeland Security\\u2019s federal protective service, who was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland, California. Dave\\u2019s heroism is emblematic of the heroes that serve in blue every day and we\\u2019re privileged tonight to be joined by his sister Angela. Angela, we say to you, we grieve with your family and America will never forget or fail to honor Officer Dave Patrick Underwood.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (25:28)\\nThe American people know we don\\u2019t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with our African-American neighbors to improve the quality of their lives, education, jobs, and safety, and from the first days of this administration, we\\u2019ve done both, and we will keep supporting law enforcement and keep supporting our African-American and minority communities across this land for four more years.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (26:18)\\nNow Joe Biden says that America is systemically racist and that law enforcement in America has and I quote \\u201d an implicit bias against minorities.\\u201d When asked whether he\\u2019d support cutting funding to law enforcement, Joe Biden replied, \\u201cYes. Absolutely.\\u201d Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading to violence in America\\u2019s cities. The hard truth is you won\\u2019t be safe in Joe Biden\\u2019s America. Under President Trump, we will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line and we\\u2019re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (27:28)\\nMy fellow Americans we\\u2019re passing through a time of testing, but soon we will come to a time for choosing. Joe Biden has referred to himself as a transition candidate and many were asking transition to what? Last week, Democrats didn\\u2019t talk very much about their agenda, and if I were them I wouldn\\u2019t either. Bernie Sanders did tell his followers that Joe Biden would be the most liberal president in modern times. In fact, he said, \\u201cThat many of the ideas he fought for that just a few years ago were considered radical are now mainstream in the Democratic Party.\\u201d At the root of their agenda is the belief that America is driven by envy, not aspiration. That millions of Americans harbor ill will toward our neighbors instead of loving our neighbors as ourselves. The radical left believes that the federal government must be involved in every aspect of our lives to correct those American wrongs. They believe the federal government needs to dictate how Americans live, how we should work, how we should raise our children and in the process deprive our people of freedom, prosperity and security. Their agenda is based on government control. Our agenda is based on freedom.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (29:09)\\nWhere President Trump cut taxes, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by nearly $4 trillion. Where this president achieved energy independence for the United States, Joe Biden would abolish fossil fuels, end fracking, and impose a regime of climate change regulations that would drastically increase the cost of living for working families. Where we fought for free and fair trade and this president stood up to China and ended the era of economic surrender, Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China. He wants to repeal all the tariffs that are leveling the playing field for American workers and he actually criticized President Trump for suspending all travel to China at the outset of this pandemic.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (30:01)\\n\\u2026 at the outset of this pandemic. Joe Biden is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and healthcare for illegal immigrants and President Trump, he secured our border and built nearly 300 miles of that border wall. Joe Biden wants to end school choice and President Trump believes that every parent should have the right to choose where their children go to school, regardless of their income or area code. President Trump has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life every day of this administration. Joe Biden, he supports taxpayer funding of abortion right up to the moment of birth. When you consider their agenda, it\\u2019s clear. Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (31:12)\\nThe choice in this election has never been clearer and the stakes have never been higher. Last week, Joe Biden said democracy is on the ballot and the truth is our economic recovery is on the ballot. Law and order are on the ballot. But so are things far more fundamental and foundational to our country. In this election it\\u2019s not so much whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, more Republican or more Democrat. The choice in this election is whether America remains America. It\\u2019s whether we will leave to our children and our grandchildren a country grounded in our highest ideals of freedom, free markets and the unalienable right to life and Liberty, or whether we will leave them a country that\\u2019s fundamentally transformed into something else.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (32:15)\\nWe stand at a crossroads, America. President Trump has set our nation on a path of freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden would set America on a path of socialism and decline, but we\\u2019re not going to let it happen. President Donald Trump believes in America and in the goodness of the American people, the boundless potential of every American to live out their dreams and freedom. Every day, President Trump has been fighting to protect the promise of America. Every day our president has been fighting to expand the reach of the American dream. Every day, President Donald Trump has been fighting for you, and now it\\u2019s our turn to fight for him.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (33:16)\\nOn this night in the company of heroes, I\\u2019m deeply grateful. Deeply grateful for the privilege of serving as vice president of this great nation and to have the opportunity to serve again. I pray to be worthy of it and I will give that duty all that\\u2019s in me. In the year 2020, the American people have had more than our share of challenges, but thankfully we have a president with the toughness, energy, and resolve to see us through. Now, those traits actually run in our national character. As the invading force learned on approach to this Fort in September of 1814, against fierce and sustained bombardment, our young country was defended by heroes, not so different from those who are with us tonight. The enemy was counting on them to quit, but they never did. Fort McHenry held, and when morning came, our flag was still here.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (34:52)\\nMy fellow Americans, we\\u2019re going through a time of testing, but if you look through the fog of these challenging times, you will see, our flag is still there today. That star spangled banner still waves over the land of the free and the home of the brave. From these hallowed grounds, American patriots in generations gone by did their part to defend freedom. Now it\\u2019s our turn. So let\\u2019s run the race marked out for us. Let\\u2019s fix our eyes on Old Glory and all she represents. Let\\u2019s fix our eyes on this land of heroes and let their courage inspire. Let\\u2019s fix our eyes on the author and perfecter of our faith and our freedom, and never forget that where the spirit of the Lord is there is freedom. That means freedom always wins.\\nVice President Mike Pence : (36:29)\\nMy fellow Americans, thank you for the honor of addressing you tonight and the opportunity to run and serve again as your vice president. I leave here today inspired and I leave here today, more convinced than ever that we will do in our time as Americans have done throughout our long and storied past, we will defend our freedom and our way of life. We will reelect our president and principled Republican leaders across the land and with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years, and with God\\u2019s help, we will make America great again, again. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United Sates of America.\",\n          \"George Stephanopoulos: (00:26)\\nWelcome to our town hall with President Trump. Mr. President, thank you for joining us.\\nDonald Trump: (00:30)\\nThank you very much.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (00:31)\\nWe\\u2019re here with a group of Pennsylvania voters. As you can see, we\\u2019re socially distanced in this COVID era.\\nDonald Trump: (00:34)\\nI can see, definitely. There\\u2019s no doubt about it.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (00:36)\\nEveryone\\u2019s been tested. You should know that some of these people voted for you last time around, some voted for Hillary Clinton, some voted for third party candidates or no one at all. All have written their own questions. The first one comes from Paul Tubiana. Paul, take it away.\\nDonald Trump: (00:52)\\nHi, Paul.\\nPaul Tubiana: (00:56)\\nMr. President, I voted for you in 2016. I\\u2019m conservative pro-life and diabetic. I\\u2019ve had to dodge people who don\\u2019t care about social distancing and wearing face masks. I thought you were doing a good job with a pandemic response until about May 1st. Then you took your foot off the gas pedal. Why did you throw vulnerable people like me under the bus?\\nDonald Trump: (01:22)\\nWell, we really didn\\u2019t, Paul. We\\u2019ve worked very hard on the pandemic. We\\u2019ve worked very hard. It came off from China. They should have never let it happen. If you look at what we\\u2019ve done with ventilators and now, frankly, with vaccines, we\\u2019re very close to having a good vaccine. If you want to know the truth, the previous administration would have taken perhaps years to have a vaccine because of the FDA and all the approvals. And we\\u2019re within weeks of getting it, could be three weeks, four weeks, but we think we have a Johnson \u0026 Johnson Pfizer. We have great companies and they\\u2019re very, very close. It\\u2019s a terrible thing. But if you look at as an example, are you from New York? Where are you from?\\nPaul Tubiana: (02:05)\\nOriginally, I\\u2019m from New York. I\\u2019ve lived in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania for 18 and a half years. It\\u2019s the longest place I\\u2019ve ever lived.\\nDonald Trump: (02:12)\\nWell, that\\u2019s very good. It\\u2019s a good place. But actually, if you look at what we\\u2019ve done for various things, we built hospitals. New York, we took the Convention Center, converted it to 2,800 rooms. We brought in the ships. I wish they would have used it because frankly they would have saved a lot of people had they used it, but we really are. We\\u2019re starting to get very good marks. If you look at what we\\u2019ve done compared to other countries with the excess mortality, the excess mortality rate, we\\u2019ve done very, very well.\\nDonald Trump: (02:40)\\nWhen you see our testing, we\\u2019re going to be at 84 million tests, 84 million. Think of that. And next would be India with about 50 million less. Our testing program\\u2019s far greater. I brought this along today because I think it\\u2019s something that\\u2019s really very special. We have a new test that came out literally today, that\\u2019s just showing you a numbers of how well we\\u2019re doing relative to other countries.\\nDonald Trump: (03:05)\\nBut this is actually a new test just came out from Abbott, highly sophisticated. You wouldn\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a piece of a really little light cardboard. This came out and this is a very accurate test and people will be able to have this and they\\u2019ll be able to test or ideally go through a doctor. But it\\u2019s very simple and very accurate.\\nDonald Trump: (03:27)\\nWe supplied governors including this state with equipment like nobody\\u2019s ever gotten. We were short on ventilators because the cupboards were bare when we took it over. We\\u2019re now making thousands of ventilators a month, many thousands that we\\u2019re sending, and we don\\u2019t need them in our country anymore. Not one person that needed a ventilator, didn\\u2019t get a ventilator. Everybody got a ventilator and, Paul, they\\u2019re very complex. They\\u2019re very hard to make, but we\\u2019re making out tens of thousands a month and sending them to other countries who are in dire need of them.\\nDonald Trump: (03:59)\\nI feel that we\\u2019ve done a tremendous job, actually and it\\u2019s something that I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s been recognized like it should. But when you look at our testing, when you look at our swabs, when you look at our ventilators, when you look at what we\\u2019ve done with hospitals, and we\\u2019ve made a lot of governors look very good and now some are in a shutdown and some aren\\u2019t, we\\u2019d like to see it open up and open up as soon as possible. But we\\u2019re very proud of the job we\\u2019ve done, and we\\u2019ve saved a lot of lives, a tremendous number of lives.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (04:28)\\nMr. President, you mentioned a number of things. Let\\u2019s talk about the mortality first, because you said we\\u2019re doing better in mortality than other countries. But here\\u2019s this chart right here. It shows the United States is right here. This is number of deaths per million residents. Here\\u2019s Western Europe here, Canada way down there. We\\u2019re not at the top of the list.\\nDonald Trump: (04:44)\\nThe excess mortality rate is among the best in the whole world. I mean, I can show you there\\u2019s a chart that just came out a little while ago. Excess mortality rate is compared to Europe, compared to other places, it\\u2019s about 25% better. In one case, it\\u2019s over 60% better. And we also have a very big country here. This is, we\\u2019re talking about a lot bigger than most countries. When you look at testing, just as an example, when India does 40 million less tests than us, they have 1.5 billion people. China, you don\\u2019t get the accurate numbers out of China, but China, they lost a lot of people. They just don\\u2019t say what-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (05:22)\\nActually, we have 4% of the world\\u2019s population, more than 20% of the cases, more than 20% of the deaths.\\nDonald Trump: (05:28)\\nWell, we have 20% of the cases because of the fact that we do much more testing. If we wouldn\\u2019t do testing, you wouldn\\u2019t have cases. You would have very few cases.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (05:35)\\nAs you know, Dr. Fauci, says most of these are actual cases.\\nDonald Trump: (05:38)\\nWell, Dr. Fauci, said we\\u2019ve done a fantastic job. He just said it yesterday. Actually, he said we\\u2019ve done a fantastic job that we didn\\u2019t mislead anybody. Now. I\\u2019m not going to make people feel like I want to\\u2026 Look, with a leader of a great country, we want to keep it that way. I don\\u2019t want to scare people. I don\\u2019t want to make people panic and you\\u2019re not going to go out and say, \\u201cOh, this is going to be. This is death, death, death.\\u201d You have to run a country. We\\u2019re in a country. We got hit by something very unfairly.\\nDonald Trump: (06:08)\\nWhat I noticed yesterday Dr. Fauci, said that we\\u2019ve done a really good job and we didn\\u2019t mislead anybody. He came out with that statement, which I appreciate. But whether it\\u2019s Dr. Fauci, or anybody else, a lot of people got it wrong. They talked about, don\\u2019t wear masks, and now they say wear masks, although some people say don\\u2019t wear masks. I mean, you have a lot of different ideas. Some people say, \\u201cJust leave it the way it is and don\\u2019t do any shutdowns.\\u201d Other people say, \\u201cDo shutdowns.\\u201d I have my own views on that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (06:37)\\nWhat did you get wrong? You say a lot of people got things wrong. I mean, you mentioned China at the top right there. All through January and February, you were down playing by your own admission, the severity of the crisis that you didn\\u2019t want to panic people.\\nDonald Trump: (06:50)\\nNot down playing-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (06:50)\\nLet me just finish the question first.\\nDonald Trump: (06:51)\\nNot downplaying.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (06:53)\\nBut you said, those are your words.\\nDonald Trump: (06:54)\\nI don\\u2019t want to drive our nation into a panic. I\\u2019m a cheerleader for this nation. I\\u2019m the one that closed up our country. I closed it up long before any of the experts thought I should and saved hundreds of thousands of lives. But when I closed it, I put a ban on our country. And the ban was a very important ban because China [crosstalk 00:07:12]. China was heavily infected.\\nDonald Trump: (07:15)\\nBy the way, I read where other people said, \\u201cDo it.\\u201d No people that I saw said do it, and I know they said security advisers and others. I put a ban on when it wasn\\u2019t at all popular. Joe Biden said I was xenophobic because I put the ban on, and I thought that was a very unfair. By the way, he\\u2019s totally taken that back. But I\\u2019m not sure he knows what it means, anyway.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (07:36)\\nI want to ask you about China though, because at that time you were actually praising President Xi. You were saying he was transparent. You were saying he was strong. You were saying he was doing a good job. Did you get that wrong? Did you misjudge President Xi?\\nDonald Trump: (07:48)\\nI don\\u2019t think I did. We just finished a trade deal. We just had the largest order of corn in the history of our country last week, the largest order of soybeans, largest order of beef, because they know I\\u2019m very unhappy. They know I\\u2019m very, very-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (08:00)\\nBut you said he was doing a good job and now you\\u2019re blaming China.\\nDonald Trump: (08:02)\\nNo, I didn\\u2019t say one way or the other. I\\u2019m not saying one way or the other. At the beginning before anybody knew what it was, I spoke with President Xi and he said, \\u201cWe are doing it well. We are having it under control.\\u201d And I was very open with that. He told me that it was under control, that everything was, and it turned out to be not true, because it wasn\\u2019t under control. It went all over the world, 188 countries.\\nDonald Trump: (08:25)\\nI didn\\u2019t say anything bad about President Xi initially, because nobody knew much about the disease. Nobody knew the seniors are susceptible. They thought people would be susceptible, but not\\u2026 The seniors are really a very, very endangered group of people, especially if they have problems with hearts or diabetes or any of that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (08:43)\\nYou mentioned masks. We had Julie Bard, who\\u2019s from Gibsonia, Pennsylvania. She\\u2019s right here. She has a question about that. You voted for Hillary Clinton last time, I believe.\\nJulie Bard: (08:51)\\nYes, I did. The wearing of mask has proven to lessen the spread of COVID. Why don\\u2019t you support a mandate for national mass wearing, and why don\\u2019t you wear a mask more often?\\nDonald Trump: (09:02)\\nWell, I do wear them when I have to, and when I\\u2019m in hospitals and other locations. But I will say this, they said at the Democrat Convention, they\\u2019re going to do a national mandate. They never did it, because they\\u2019ve checked out and they didn\\u2019t do it. A good question, as you ask, like Joe Biden, they said, \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to do a national mandate unrest-\\u201d\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (09:24)\\nHe\\u2019s called on all governors to have them. It is the state responsibility.\\nDonald Trump: (09:26)\\nNo, but he didn\\u2019t do it. I mean, he never did it. By the way, a lot of people don\\u2019t want to wear masks. There are a lot of people think that masks are not good. And there are a lot of people that, as an example, you have-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (09:38)\\nWho are those people?\\nDonald Trump: (09:39)\\nI\\u2019ll tell you who those people are, waiters. They come over and they serve you, and they have a mask. I saw it the other day where they were serving me and they\\u2019re playing with a mask. I\\u2019m not blaming them. I\\u2019m just saying what happens. They\\u2019re playing with a mask, and so the mask is over and they\\u2019re touching it. And then they\\u2019re touching the plate. That can\\u2019t be good.\\nDonald Trump: (09:58)\\nThere are a lot of people, if you look at Dr. Fauci\\u2019s original statement, you look at a lot of people, CDC, you look at a lot of people\\u2019s original statement, they said very strongly George, \\u201cDon\\u2019t wear masks.\\u201d Then all of a sudden they want to wear masks. The concept of a mask is good, but it also does, you\\u2019re constantly touching it, you\\u2019re touching your face, you\\u2019re touching plates. There are people that don\\u2019t think masks are good.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (10:22)\\nLet\\u2019s get one final question on COVID. We\\u2019ve got Johnny Powell right here. She\\u2019s from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and you actually haven\\u2019t voted before. How are you?\\nJohnny Powell: (10:31)\\nHello. Hi. My question is, if you believe it\\u2019s the president\\u2019s responsibility to protect America, why would you downplay a pandemic that is known to disproportionately harm low income families and minority communities?\\nDonald Trump: (10:47)\\nYeah. Well, I didn\\u2019t downplay it. I actually, in many ways I applied it in terms of action. [crosstalk 00:10:54]. My action was very strong because what I did was with China, I put a ban on, with Europe, I put a ban on, and we would have lost thousands of more people had I not put the ban on. So that was called action. Not with the mouth, but in actual fact, we did a very, very good job when we put that ban on, whether you call it talent or luck, it was very important. So we saved a lot of lives when we did that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (11:18)\\nThere were holes in the ban and the European ban didn\\u2019t come for another month.\\nDonald Trump: (11:22)\\nWell, they were Americans. I mean, the holes in were if you have somebody in China, that\\u2019s an American citizen, we had to let them in. I mean, there were actually some people that said, well, once it got going, they said, \\u201cWait a minute. That is really a heavily infected place.\\u201d We had a case where we had a lot of Americans, they probably had COVID and we\\u2019re saying, \\u201cDo we let them into our country?\\u201d We let them in very carefully. We quarantined them, but we let them in. But yeah, they say that we allowed certain people and it\\u2019s true, but they were American citizens.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (11:54)\\nI want to move on to some other subjects, but we\\u2019re still [inaudible 00:11:56] with 195,000 deaths in the United States right now. When you see that, when you think about that, does that give you any pause? Does it make you think, \\u201cIs there anything I could have done differently?\\u201d Anything-\\nDonald Trump: (12:07)\\nI think we could have had 2 million deaths if we didn\\u2019t close out the country.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (12:11)\\nSo you regret nothing?\\nDonald Trump: (12:12)\\nNo, I think we did a great job. If we didn\\u2019t close the country, look, we created, I created, we all created it together. You helped everybody. The fact is, we created the greatest economy in the history of the world, best employment numbers for African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, women, everything, the best employment, high school, no high school, college. We had the best economy we\\u2019ve ever had. 160 million people almost, just short of 160 million people. We were never closed.\\nDonald Trump: (12:42)\\nAnd then somebody comes in and then somebody else, doctors, and they start talking about the pandemic and about closing, they want to close up our country. I said, \\u201cWait a minute. We have the greatest country, the greatest economy.\\u201d And it was coming together, even in terms of unity, because it was so successful that people that weren\\u2019t getting along were starting to get along, George. That\\u2019s the way we solved that problem. But we had the greatest economy ever, and we have to close it. If I didn\\u2019t close it, I think you\\u2019d have 2 million deaths instead of having the 185, 190. It\\u2019s a terrible. [crosstalk 00:13:15].\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (13:17)\\n\\u2026 more mitigation earlier on, there would have been fewer deaths.\\nDonald Trump: (13:21)\\nGeorge, I was so far ahead of my closing. I\\u2019ll give you an example. When I closed at the end of January, Joe Biden was talking about in March about it\\u2019s totally over-exaggerated. Nancy Pelosi was standing in the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco, late a month, more than a month after that saying, \\u201cThis thing\\u2019s totally exaggerated, come to try and build up tourism.\\u201d And all of these people-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (13:50)\\nYou were saying it was going to disappear.\\nDonald Trump: (13:51)\\nWhat?\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (13:51)\\nYou\\u2019re saying it was going to disappear.\\nDonald Trump: (13:53)\\nIt is going to disappear. It\\u2019s going to disappear. I still say that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (13:56)\\nBut not if you don\\u2019t take action. Correct?\\nDonald Trump: (13:58)\\nNo, I still say it. It\\u2019s going to disappear, George. We\\u2019re going to get back. We aren\\u2019t going to have studios like this. We have all of this empty space in between. I want to see people and you want to see people. I want to see football games. I\\u2019m pushing very hard for Big Ten. I want to see Big Ten open, lift the football games, let them play sports. But no, it\\u2019s going to disappear, George. And I say this-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (14:16)\\nBut Dr. Fauci, say we have to hunker down. We have to be prepared for a possible second wave. I understand that you don\\u2019t want to panic people. You said you want people to be calm. You\\u2019ve often talked about Winston Churchill, and FDR, and they did reassure people. They were strong. They did keep people calm, but they also were straight. They said, \\u201cThis war is going to be tough. It\\u2019s going to be a real fight. We have to persevere.\\u201d\\nDonald Trump: (14:39)\\nWhen Churchill was on the top of a building, and he said, \\u201cEverything\\u2019s going to be good. Everything\\u2019s going to be. Be calm.\\u201d And you have the Nazis dropping bombs all over London, he was very brave because he was at the top of a building. It was very well known that he was standing on buildings and they were bombing. And he says, \\u201cEveryone\\u2019s going to be safe.\\u201d I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s being necessarily honest, and yet I think it\\u2019s being a great leader.\\nDonald Trump: (15:03)\\nBut he said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to be safe. Be calm. Don\\u2019t panic.\\u201d And you had bombers dropping bombs all over London. So I guess you could say, that\\u2019s not so honest, but it\\u2019s still great leadership.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (15:17)\\nDo you think it\\u2019s okay to be dishonest?\\nDonald Trump: (15:19)\\nI\\u2019m not looking to be dishonest. I don\\u2019t want people to panic, and we are going to be okay. We\\u2019re going to be okay, and it is going away. It\\u2019s probably going to go away now a lot faster because of the vaccine. It would go away without the vaccine, George, but it\\u2019s going to go away a lot faster-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (15:33)\\nIt will go away without the vaccine?\\nDonald Trump: (15:34)\\nSure. Over a period of time. Sure, with time, it goes away.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (15:37)\\nAnd many deaths.\\nDonald Trump: (15:39)\\nYou\\u2019ll develope like a hard mentality, it\\u2019s going to be hard developed, and that\\u2019s going to happen. That will all happen. But with the vaccine, I think it will go away very quickly.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (15:50)\\nWe\\u2019ve got to take a quick break.\\nDonald Trump: (15:50)\\nBut I really believe we\\u2019re rounding the corner, and I believe that strongly.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (15:53)\\nAs you know, Dr, Fauci, disagrees with that.\\nDonald Trump: (15:55)\\nWell, I mean, but a lot of people do agree with me. You look at Scott Atlas, you look at some of the other doctors that are highlighted from Stanford, look at some of the other doctors, they think maybe we could have done that from the beginning. I think we did it exactly right. We closed it up. Now, we\\u2019re opening and we\\u2019re opening up to a super-vee because the numbers are fantastic.\\nDonald Trump: (16:15)\\nThe employment numbers, you look at, we hired 10.4 million jobs in four months. That\\u2019s a record by far. We have every record. Retail sales are through the roof. We have every record. We did the right thing. If we didn\\u2019t close it up, I believe we\\u2019d have two million, two and a half, maybe three million deaths.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (16:35)\\nWe\\u2019re going to have take more about [inaudible 00:16:35] when we come back. But also race, policing, and protests. We\\u2019ll be right back.Welcome back to our town hall with President Trump. The next question comes from Laura Galvis. She\\u2019s from Glen Shaw, Pennsylvania. Registered nurse, who\\u2019s always voted Republican for president. Laura, go ahead.\\nLaura Galvis: (19:40)\\nHello, Mr. President. Martin Luther King Jr, once famously wrote, \\u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\\u201d In the light of the ongoing protests surrounding the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and the recent shooting of Jacob Blake, do you feel racial injustices are occurring in this nation? And if so, what can be done to address them?\\nDonald Trump: (20:05)\\nWell, I think they were tragic events, and I do feel that we have to also take into consideration that if you look at our police, they do a phenomenal job. You\\u2019ll have people joke, make mistakes, and they happen. It happens where they have to make a fast decision and some bad things happen. And you also have bad apples, but you have 99% great people. I know the police forces very well. I think almost every one of them. If you look, I\\u2019ve been endorsed by so many of them, and these are great people.\\nDonald Trump: (20:37)\\nI will say this, if you\\u2019re going to stop crime, we have to give the respect back to the police that they deserve. They\\u2019ve done a fantastic job in many locations, but then bad things happen. Look at New York, New York was a very safe city. Rudy Giuliani did a fantastic job. The city was safe, and then all of a sudden we have a mayor. He starts cutting the police force and crime is up a hundred percent, 150%. I saw one form of crime up 300%.\\nDonald Trump: (21:05)\\nSo I think it\\u2019s very important, whether you talk Seattle, where they have very good police, but they\\u2019re not allowed to do their job. You have to allow the police to do their job. I agree with you, those events are terrible, but we have to allow the police to do their job. Otherwise, crime is going to soar.\\nDonald Trump: (21:22)\\nNow, the problem is that in Democrat, usually liberal Democrat run cities, we have tremendous problems. The top 10 most unsafe cities are run by Democrats. You go into the top 25 and top 35, almost every one of them is run by Democrats. No cash bail, just weak policies on crime. We have to give the police the respect that they deserve and we have to give them their mojo. We have to let them protect us.\\nDonald Trump: (21:52)\\nHow about that horrible crime that took place two days ago, where this terrible human being walks up to a police car with two people sitting in the car and he starts shooting bullets right through the glass right in their face and just has destroyed? I hear they\\u2019re going to make it, but they\\u2019re going to have a hard time ever being the same-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (22:11)\\nMr. President-\\nDonald Trump: (22:12)\\nIt\\u2019s just a terrible thing.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (22:14)\\nThat was monstrous. There\\u2019s no question about that. But a lot of people look at the-\\nDonald Trump: (22:18)\\nBut that\\u2019s a lack of respect. When somebody can do that, that\\u2019s a lack of respect. There\\u2019s no retribution. The field, there\\u2019s no retribution. This guy walks up to a police car and he starts shooting point blank range at two innocent people. You can\\u2019t let that happen. You have to be very tough on crime when it comes to that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (22:37)\\nTough on crime, but also obey the rules and regulations for policing. You talk about police choking, you talk about bad apples, but a lot of people look at the statistics, Black Americans, more than three times more likely than White Americans to be killed by police. That indicates that this just isn\\u2019t bad apples. This just isn\\u2019t choking. This is a real systemic endemic problem. Do you believe that? What will you do to address it?\\nDonald Trump: (23:02)\\nSo, just do a poll where\\u2026\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (23:03)\\nDo you believe that? What will you do to address it?\\nDonald Trump: (23:03)\\nI just saw a poll where African-Americans in this country, black communities are 81% in favor of having more police. They want more police. They want protection. They suffer more than anybody else by bad police protection. All minorities, whether it\\u2019s Hispanic or black or Asian, they suffer more than anybody else, George. We have to give the police back the authority to stop crime. When you have something like in Portland, where it\\u2019s just night after night, I could stop that with the people we have in a half an hour if they\\u2019d let me do that, but they don\\u2019t-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (23:39)\\nWhat would you do?\\nDonald Trump: (23:41)\\nBring in the National Guard. We\\u2019d bring it in, and we would stop that within\\u2026 Well, we did it in Minneapolis. Take a look at Minneapolis-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (23:47)\\nHow do you stop police killing blacks at three times the rate of killing whites?\\nDonald Trump: (23:52)\\nI can only say this, that the police in this country have done generally a great job. There are crimes, there are problems, and there are chokers. They choke under pressure. They have one quarter of a second to make a decision, and sometimes they make a wrong decision. That\\u2019s a terrible thing. The problem is that\\u2019ll be on the news for two weeks or three weeks in a row, and the hundreds of thousands and thousands of good acts, nobody talks about it.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (24:19)\\nYou didn\\u2019t think that\\u2019s a sign of systemic racism?\\nDonald Trump: (24:21)\\nNo, I think there\\u2019s problems, but I also think there\\u2019s some very big problems where if you don\\u2019t give the police back their authority\\u2026 Right now, police are afraid they\\u2019re going to lose their pension, they\\u2019re going to lose their job if they talk to somebody in the wrong way. When I watch New York\\u2026 The New York City Police endorse me, and I love them. [crosstalk 00:24:42] but I watched six months ago, policemen walking down the street, and people were dumping water on their head. They had absolutely no fear. They had absolutely\\u2026 There was no retribution. I thought it was a low point. I thought it was a low point for New York City\\u2019s finest.\\nDonald Trump: (24:59)\\nFrankly, those people should\\u2019ve turned\\u2026 Those cops should\\u2019ve turned around and really done something.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (25:04)\\nWe have another question on the subject from Pastor Carl Day. He\\u2019s from Philadelphia, voted for Jill Stein last time.\\nPastor Carl Day: (25:10)\\nHow you doing, Mr. President?\\nDonald Trump: (25:12)\\nGood.\\nPastor Carl Day: (25:12)\\nYou\\u2019ve coined the phrase, \\u201cMake America great again.\\u201d When has America been great for African-Americans in the ghetto of America? Are you aware of how tone deaf that comes off to the African-American community?\\nDonald Trump: (25:25)\\nWell, I can say this. We have tremendous African-American support. You\\u2019ve probably seen it in the polls. We\\u2019re doing extremely well with African-American, Hispanic-American at levels that you\\u2019ve rarely seen a republican have. If you talk about make America great, if you look at just prior to, and I\\u2019m talking about for the black community, you look just prior to this horrible situation coming in from China, when the virus came in, that was probably the highest point. Home ownership for the black community, home ownership, lower crime, the best jobs they\\u2019ve ever had, highest income, the best employment numbers they\\u2019ve ever had. If you go back and you want to look over many years, you could just go back six or seven months from now, that was the best single moment in the history of the African-American people in this country, I think, I would say.\\nPastor Carl Day: (26:21)\\nWell, I mean, your statement is, \\u201cMake it great again.\\u201d Historically, the African-American experience, especially in these ghettos that have been redlined historically, these ghettos that have systemically been treated the way that they have been, the conditions of the drugs, the guns, and everything else that actually created the symptoms for what we see that you profess to be just the democratic cities themselves, these things have been historically been happening for African-Americans in these ghettos, and we have not been seeing a change. Quite frankly, under your administration, under Obama\\u2019s administration, under the Bush, under the Clinton, the very same things happen, and the very same systems and cycles continue to ensue, and we need to see, because you say again, we need to see when was that great, because that pushes us back to a time in which we cannot identify with such greatness.\\nPastor Carl Day: (27:15)\\nI mean, you\\u2019ve said everything else about choking and everything else, but you have yet to address and acknowledge that there\\u2019s been a race problem in America.\\nDonald Trump: (27:22)\\nIf you go\\u2026 Well, I hope there\\u2019s not a race problem. I can tell you, there\\u2019s none with me, because I have great respect for all races, for everybody. This country is great because of it, but when you go back six months and you take a look at what was happening, you can\\u2019t even compare that with past administrations. When you look at income levels, and a lot of things, because of the job situation, where they had the lowest income, the best unemployment numbers they\\u2019ve ever had, the black community, by far, and that was solving a lot of problems. You know what else? It was bringing people together. I was starting to get, just before\\u2026 We were having a long run of success. I was starting to get calls from democrats that, \\u201cHey, it\\u2019s starting to work. Let\\u2019s get together.\\u201d People that you would never have thought this would\\u2019ve happened with, there was going to be unity, but unfortunately, that was hurt because we got set back.\\nDonald Trump: (28:14)\\nNow, I think next year\\u2019s going to be one of our best years economically, but [crosstalk 00:28:18]\\nPastor Carl Day: (28:18)\\nIncome equality is higher. I mean, jobs can be produced, but at the same time, in a lot of these big major cities where African-Americans are underserved, under-resourced, that\\u2019s an $8 an hour job, does not meant that they can necessarily afford to live where they have to live or where they\\u2019ve been living at for the last 20 years.\\nDonald Trump: (28:36)\\nWell, the income inequality, which I agree with you is a problem, I always agreed with that, but if you looked under President Obama and Biden, the income inequality was phenomenal. It was record setting. It was-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (28:49)\\nIt\\u2019s getting worse now.\\nDonald Trump: (28:51)\\nWell, we\\u2019re talking about a plague coming in. Before the plague, we were doing very well. Now, we will soon be doing well again, because we\\u2019re going to have a fantastic third quarter. You\\u2019re seeing the numbers come in. I think you\\u2019re going to have a GDP that\\u2019s mid 20s and may be much higher. Somebody said 35. I don\\u2019t know. These are all records we\\u2019re talking about. You\\u2019re going to have a very good\\u2026 Economically, you\\u2019re going to have a very good year next year, but I agree with a lot of the things you say, but you have to look back, because we really had it going well. Had we not been hit by this horrible disease that came into our land and all over the world, by the way, came all over the world, we would be in a position where I think income inequality would be different. It was really getting there. We were really driving it down.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (29:36)\\nMr. President, we have to move on, but even before the pandemic, the average black family was earning half of what the average white family was earning. Even if you hold education constant-\\nDonald Trump: (29:45)\\nI can only compare it to the past. The African-American, the black community was doing better than it had ever done by far, both in terms of unemployment, home ownership, so many different statistics, even in terms of crime-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (30:02)\\nThere\\u2019s still a gap between blacks and whites.\\nDonald Trump: (30:04)\\nI mean, there was a gap, but we were doing a good job. It was getting better. Then, it was artificially shut down by this disease that came onto our land.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (30:13)\\nGot to take another break. We\\u2019ll be right back.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (34:28)\\nWelcome back to our town hall. We\\u2019re taking questions from voters in Pennsylvania who\\u2019ve not yet made up their minds for a final decision in this election. The next question comes from Leah Schwotzer of Pittsburgh.\\nLeah Schwotzer: (34:38)\\nHello.\\nDonald Trump: (34:39)\\nHi.\\nLeah Schwotzer: (34:40)\\nI worry about a second or third wave of unemployment. Employers that weathered the first six months of COVID-19 are now seeing their businesses dramatically impacted due to the effect of this virus on our economy. What, as a president, is your plan to aid these workers who may not lose their jobs today, but in the months to come?\\nDonald Trump: (35:01)\\nWell, as you know, we did pay check, but we\\u2019re doing a lot of other things. But, what I want to do is see some additional stimulus. We\\u2019re trying to get it, and we may. I mean, just before I came here, we had some pretty good talks with the democrats. We\\u2019ll see, but they\\u2019ve been very difficult-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (35:14)\\nWhy not call the Speaker down to your office, hammer it out [crosstalk 00:35:17]\\nDonald Trump: (35:17)\\nBecause, they know exactly where I stand. At the right time, I\\u2019ll do that, but they know exactly where I stand. What they want is a bail out of democrat run states that are doing poorly. I don\\u2019t think this is the right way-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (35:28)\\nWhy do you keep talking about democrat states?\\nDonald Trump: (35:30)\\nThey are.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (35:30)\\nThey\\u2019re American states and American cities.\\nDonald Trump: (35:32)\\nNo, the democrat run states are the ones that are doing badly, George. If you look at New York, if you look at Illinois, if you look at a lot of different places, they\\u2019re doing poorly, and cities in particular. Cities, I mean, these cities are being run so poorly-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (35:44)\\nDon\\u2019t you have a responsibility for those states and cities as well?\\nDonald Trump: (35:47)\\n\\u2026 but largely because of the crime. They don\\u2019t want to do anything about crime. Sanctuary cities. They have sanctuary cities where they\\u2019re protecting criminals. They have things that the republicans don\\u2019t have. So, they are. I don\\u2019t want to say\\u2026 Look, I\\u2019m the president of everybody, but I don\\u2019t want to say it, but they\\u2019re democrat run cities. It is what it is.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (36:07)\\nWill you be calling the Speaker in? Can you hammer out a deal?\\nDonald Trump: (36:09)\\nAt the right time, yes, I would like to see additional stimulus for people that really, it wasn\\u2019t their fault. It wasn\\u2019t your fault, wasn\\u2019t anybody\\u2019s fault. It was China\\u2019s fault. I don\\u2019t care how you want to define it. This was China\\u2019s fault, and our people shouldn\\u2019t be hurt. We should do stimulus. We did a lot of it initially, and now they stopped, because they think it\\u2019s going to be better for the election.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (36:33)\\nThey say if you\\u2019ll come up, they said they\\u2019ll meet you halfway on the money.\\nDonald Trump: (36:37)\\nWell, we can do something maybe, but I\\u2019m just hearing for the first time about an hour ago that maybe there is a chance to get something, and I\\u2019d like to do it. I would like to see it happen, George.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (36:46)\\nNext question\\u2019s on healthcare. It comes from Ellesia Blaque. She\\u2019s from Philadelphia, an assistant professor who voted for Hillary Clinton last time.\\nEllesia Blaque: (36:54)\\nHi.\\nDonald Trump: (36:55)\\nHi.\\nEllesia Blaque: (36:56)\\nMr. President, I was born with a disease called sarcoidosis. From the day I was born, I was considered uninsurable. That disease started in my skin, moved to my eyes, into my optic nerves, and when I went to graduate school, into my brain. When it hit my brain, I was automatically eligible for disability for the rest of my life. I chose instead to get a bachelor\\u2019s degree, a master\\u2019s degree, a PhD, and become a professor.\\nDonald Trump: (37:27)\\nThat\\u2019s great.\\nEllesia Blaque: (37:27)\\nIt is great, except I still have similar healthcare problems. It costs me, with copays, I\\u2019m still paying almost $7,000 a year in addition to the copay, and should preexisting conditions, which Obamacare brought to fruition be removed-\\nDonald Trump: (37:47)\\nNo.\\nEllesia Blaque: (37:48)\\nPlease stop and let me finish my question, sir. Should that be removed? Within a 36 to 72 hour period without my medication, I will be dead. I want to know what it is that you\\u2019re going to do to ensure that people like me who work hard, we do everything we\\u2019re supposed to do, can stay insured. It\\u2019s not my fault that I was born with this disease. It\\u2019s not my fault that I\\u2019m a black woman, and in the medical community, I\\u2019m minimized and not taken seriously. I want to know what you are going to do about that.\\nDonald Trump: (38:22)\\nFirst of all, I hope you are taken seriously. I hope you are. We are not going to hurt anything having to do with preexisting conditions. We\\u2019re not going to hurt preexisting conditions, and in fact, just the opposite. If you look at what they want to do, where they have socialized medicine, they will get rid of preexisting conditions. If they go into Medicare for all, which is socialized medicine, and you can forget about your doctors and your plans, just like you can forget under President Obama. He said you can have your doctor, you can have your plan, and that turned out to be a lie. He said it 28 different times, at least. We have 28 different times. You can have your doctor, you can have your plan. Well, it\\u2019s not true. But, what we\\u2019re doing is we\\u2019re going to be doing a healthcare plan, preexisting, protecting people with preexisting conditions. As an example, yourself. It sounds like that\\u2019s exactly perfect. That\\u2019s exactly what we\\u2019re talking about. We\\u2019re going to be doing a healthcare plan very strongly, and protect people with preexisting conditions.\\nDonald Trump: (39:21)\\nI will say this, they will not do that, because they have socialized-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (39:25)\\nI have to stop you there. I just have to stop you there, because just on a couple points. Number one, Joe Biden has ran against Medicare for all in the primaries, but much more importantly, Obamacare guaranteed people with preexisting conditions could buy insurance, guaranteed they could buy it at the same price as everyone else, guaranteed a package of essential benefits, guaranteed that insurance companies couldn\\u2019t put a lifetime limit on those benefits. You fought to repeal Obamacare. You are arguing in the Supreme Court right now to strike it down. That would do away with preexisting conditions.\\nDonald Trump: (39:59)\\nNo, so we can do new healthcare.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (40:01)\\nYou\\u2019ve been promising a new healthcare plan. I interviewed you in June of last year. You said the healthcare plan would come in two weeks. You told Chris Wallace this summer, it would come in three weeks. You promised an executive order on preexisting-\\nDonald Trump: (40:12)\\nI have it already. I have it already.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (40:13)\\nBut, you\\u2019ve been trying to strike down preexisting conditions.\\nDonald Trump: (40:16)\\nIt doesn\\u2019t matter. I have it already, and it\\u2019s a much better plan for you, and it\\u2019s a much better plan.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (40:20)\\nWhat is it?\\nDonald Trump: (40:21)\\nWhen you say Obamacare, I got rid of the individual mandate, which is the worst part of Obamacare.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (40:25)\\nYou\\u2019re striking down the whole law.\\nDonald Trump: (40:27)\\nWouldn\\u2019t pertain to you, but it\\u2019d pertain to a lot of people where they were going literally bust because they didn\\u2019t want to have health insurance, and they were paying for it anyway, and it was no good. Obamacare was a disaster. Obamacare is too expensive. The premiums are too high. It\\u2019s a total disaster. You\\u2019re going to have new healthcare, and the preexisting condition aspect of it will always be in my plan, and I\\u2019ve said that loud and clear-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (40:51)\\nBut, you haven\\u2019t come up with it.\\nDonald Trump: (40:52)\\nAnd, we got rid of the individual mandate, which essentially ended Obamacare-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (40:58)\\nOnly because you\\u2019re arguing for it.\\nDonald Trump: (40:59)\\nGeorge, I had a decision to make. Do I run\\u2026 We gutted out the worst parts of Obamacare. Now, I have to make this decision. This is three years ago. Do we run Obamacare well and do a good job, and do the best, even though it\\u2019s never going to be very good, or do we let it run badly? Probably letting it run badly would\\u2019ve been a better political decision, but I couldn\\u2019t do that. We have run it so much better than Obama ran it. Now, it\\u2019s not the same because I got rid of the most unpopular thing and a very unfair thing, which was the individual mandate.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (41:32)\\nYou\\u2019re trying to strike down the whole law.\\nDonald Trump: (41:34)\\nGeorge, we have run it really well, but we also have now other\\u2026 If you go to Department of Labor, our great secretary as you know, and you know him well, we have other alternatives to Obamacare that are 50% less expensive, and they\\u2019re actually better.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (41:50)\\nIt\\u2019s been three and a half years.\\nDonald Trump: (41:51)\\nGeorge, it\\u2019s been 40 years since you had good healthcare. You never really had good healthcare in this country. This country has never had it. But, when you say that Biden doesn\\u2019t want to do it, everybody else does. Bernie does. He agreed to the manifesto as I call it. The agreement with Bernie is that you\\u2019re going to go to socialized medicine.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (42:12)\\nHe ran against Medicare for all.\\nDonald Trump: (42:14)\\nIf you go to socialized medicine\\u2026 Well, he agreed. Harris, who he today, said, Harris-Biden, because you think she\\u2019s president, Harris\\u2026 Someday, you\\u2019ll have to explain that one to me, but Harris is all for doing that. She wants to go to socialized medicine. You no longer have your doctor really, and you no longer have your plan. And, Joe can say all he wants, he\\u2019s only doing it because he sees his poll numbers going down so substantially. But, Joe can say all he wants about healthcare. Obamacare has been a failure from day one. It\\u2019s too expensive, whether it\\u2019s the premium or whether it\\u2019s the cost generally, and they don\\u2019t have their doctors, and they don\\u2019t have their plans. We\\u2019re going to have a very good healthcare. I think maybe a great healthcare for less money.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (42:58)\\nGot to take another break. We\\u2019ll be right back.\\nCommercial: (48:14)\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (48:22)\\nWelcome back to our Town Hall with President Trump. Mr President thank you for being here.\\nDonald Trump: (48:26)\\nThank you.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (48:26)\\nThe next question comes from Jim Roudeski, he\\u2019s from Irwin, Pennsylvania, that\\u2019s around Pittsburgh. And you voted for President Trump last time around.\\nDonald Trump: (48:32)\\nHi Jim.\\nJim Roudeski: (48:33)\\nHi. At times, some have called your behavior not presidential. What, if anything, would you do differently if reelected to create a more unified message where all sides can take responsibilities for their actions and come together to make positive change?\\nDonald Trump: (48:48)\\nGood Jim. So I\\u2019m fighting a battle, it\\u2019s a big battlefield and I have a lot of forces against me. I have the media, which I call the fake news, because a lot of it is fake. And I mean a big pop, as you understand, a lot of is fake. I\\u2019m fighting a lot of forces. Sometimes you don\\u2019t have time to be totally, as you would say, presidential. You have to get things done. I think I\\u2019ve done more than any other president in the first three and a half years. When you look at what we\\u2019ve done for tax cuts and regulation cuts and the vets, all of the things that we\\u2019ve done for the West, we have a 91% approval factor now for the vets, we rebuilt our military, we created Space Force. I mean, we did so many things, Right-to-try, which is so incredible and so successful. You know what Right-to-try is?\\nDonald Trump: (49:35)\\nWe did more, I really believe it, more than any other president in the first three and a half years. By the way, at the end of my first term, we\\u2019re going to have close to 300, maybe over 300 new federal judges, including Court of Appeal, two Supreme Court justices. And honestly, we move very fast and I have to get rid of people fast because they\\u2019re not doing their job. I could tell you people that weren\\u2019t doing their job. And when I do that to get somebody else that is good, and if they don\\u2019t do it, we get rid of that person.\\nDonald Trump: (50:06)\\nWe do a lot of things and we have to get them done. I could be so pres\\u2026 I always used to sort of kid on the campaign trail that I could be more presidential, would be very easy, more presidential than any other candidate, except for possibly Abraham Lincoln when he\\u2019s wearing the hat, right? The high hat. But the fact is, being presidential is easier than what I have to do, but I get things done. I get things done like nobody\\u2019s ever gotten, including environmental things. When you look at what\\u2019s going on in the country and all that we\\u2019ve done, we unfortunately got hit by this plague, but it\\u2019s going to be back very soon, we opened it up and we have\\u2026you talk Jim about the V. We have a super V, looks like it\\u2019s going to be a super V.\\nDonald Trump: (50:47)\\nWe\\u2019re going to have a great economy next year. And I think we\\u2019re going to have a great economy in the third quarter. And thank you for voting for me in 2016. I hope you\\u2019re going to do it again.\\nJim Roudeski: (50:56)\\nThanks sir.\\nDonald Trump: (50:57)\\nThank you. Thank you very much.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (50:58)\\nYou talk about a super V Mr. President. A lot of people look at this and say, it\\u2019s more like a K-shaped recovery, that people at the top who have a lot of stocks are doing pretty well. [crosstalk 00:51:06]\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (51:08)\\nBut now you\\u2019ve only gotten half the jobs back.\\nDonald Trump: (51:11)\\nGeorge, stocks are owned by everybody. I mean, they talk about the stock market is so good, that\\u2019s 401(k)s. I\\u2019m meeting people with as long as they didn\\u2019t sell when the market went down, when we first realized the extent of this horrible thing from China. I mean, these people are doing, some of them are doing better than they were doing before the pandemic came.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (51:29)\\nSo that 33.6 [inaudible 00:00:51:30].\\nDonald Trump: (51:31)\\nIf people held onto their stocks, and remember this, because I noticed you said wealthy, sure, wealthy, but you have people that aren\\u2019t wealthy, but have done well because of the stock market. I\\u2019ve set records on the stock market even during the pandemic. And that doesn\\u2019t happen by accident. I will tell you this, if Joe Biden ever got this position and that\\u2019s a headwind on the stock market, our stock market would be much higher if it weren\\u2019t for that. If Joe Biden ever got in, I think you\\u2019d have a depression, the likes of which we\\u2019ve never seen in this country. If you look at his policies, where he wants to raise everybody\\u2019s taxes, you look at what he wants to do in terms of regulation, where he wants to put all of the regulations back on that I took off, and then some, and in many cases, double it up, you will have a depression, the likes of which we haven\\u2019t seen in this country, and that doesn\\u2019t affect big people.\\nDonald Trump: (52:22)\\nIt affects everybody. It affects a person that owns $10,000 worth of stock in IBM or whatever company it may be. Look, we\\u2019re having a tremendous thing in the stock market and that\\u2019s good for everybody, but people that aren\\u2019t rich own stock and they have 401(k)s. You take a look at the 401(k)s. They\\u2019re in many cases better than they were before the pandemic came.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (52:46)\\nNext question comes from Alexandra Stehman from Pittsburgh, sat out the last presidential election, I believe.\\nAlexandra: (52:51)\\nUnfortunately so, I did.\\nDonald Trump: (52:53)\\nThank you.\\nAlexandra: (52:54)\\nGood evening Mr. President. So I\\u2019d like to ask regarding your recent comments about our United States soldiers and referring to them as suckers.\\nDonald Trump: (53:04)\\nCould you say that again?\\nAlexandra: (53:07)\\nOur United States soldiers referring to them as suckers and particularly the late John McCain, our prisoners as war losers.\\nDonald Trump: (53:17)\\nOh, oh, I see. Okay. It was a fake statement. Go ahead\\nAlexandra: (53:18)\\nAnd recently requesting to ban amputee veterans from a military parade. How do you expect to win back the support of our military, their families, their friends, and military supporters?\\nDonald Trump: (53:32)\\nIt\\u2019s easy, because they never made those statements. They were never made by me. They said, I stood over the grave of soldiers killed many years ago, and I said they were suckers. I never made that. We had 26 people as of today, come out to say it never happened, and many people were there. Then they said about the rain didn\\u2019t happen and that wasn\\u2019t the reason. The secret service said, we have a statement from them. They said that we could not travel because the helicopter couldn\\u2019t be used, we would not be able to travel. Because when you do that through a major city, it takes them days to get it prepared. I wanted to go anyway. I said, \\u201cLet me just go separately in a car in disguise. I don\\u2019t care.\\u201d I wanted to be there so badly, but the statements never happened. They were lies.\\nDonald Trump: (54:15)\\nAs far as John McCain, I was never a fan of John McCain. I never thought he treated our vets well, he didn\\u2019t do the job. I was never a fan of his, and I think that\\u2019s fine and everybody knows that, and I said it to his face. I was very much up in that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (54:30)\\nYou said he\\u2019s not a war hero.\\nDonald Trump: (54:31)\\nBut as far as [inaudible 00:54:30], I have done so much for our vets and for our military, I rebuilt our military. When I came into this great office, our military was depleted, it was in the worst shape it was in probably ever. It was depleted. The planes were old and broken, the ships, everything. You see what I\\u2019ve done. I\\u2019ve rebuilt $2.5 trillion, and you think that was easy, getting that money from Democrats? Because they don\\u2019t like the military. This magazine came up, they made up this quote. It was a made up quote. And the gloves are off with Biden who I\\u2019ve never respected greatly. I\\u2019ve never respected him greatly. But when they took this made up quote that was now knocked out by over 25 people and they made an ad out of it, I thought it was a disgrace. Do you know what disinformation is? That\\u2019s what it was.\\nDonald Trump: (55:22)\\nThey made up a phony quote and then they went with it. It was a phony deal. And the one who started it was a big friend of President Obama and Clinton. And it was a phony deal from a very not very successful [inaudible 00:55:34].\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (55:35)\\nMr. President you have used language like that in the past. You did say that John McCain wasn\\u2019t a war hero. And notably silent in the wake of this article were General John Kelly, who was your chief of staff at the time. General James Mattis, who served as defense secretary for you has said-\\nDonald Trump: (55:51)\\nThey didn\\u2019t hear me say that.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (55:52)\\nHas said, well, I\\u2019m getting to a broader point with the generals.\\nDonald Trump: (55:56)\\nBecause I never said it.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (55:57)\\nGeneral Mattis said, you\\u2019re dividing, you\\u2019re not trying to unite the country. General Kelly said he agreed with that. John Bolton, who was your National Security Advisor said you are a danger to the country. The people in these top military positions who served most closely with you have said you\\u2019re unfit for office. How do you respond to that?\\nDonald Trump: (56:14)\\nThese are people that I let go. These are disgruntled former employees to put it in a nice way with a term people would understand. Mattis was a highly overrated general, didn\\u2019t do the job, didn\\u2019t do good on ISIS. I took over a hundred percent of the ISIS caliphate. I had the people that I wanted and Mattis was fired as you know by President Obama. And I fired him also.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (56:35)\\nHe says he resigned.\\nDonald Trump: (56:36)\\nHe didn\\u2019t resign. I said, \\u201cGive me a letter.\\u201d No more. Give me a letter. I was being nice. One of the problems when you\\u2019re nice, oftentimes it comes back to hit you. I said, \\u201cJim, give me a letter. It\\u2019s time for you to move on.\\u201d He gave me a letter, but I fired him, [inaudible 00:56:50], I fired him. Now, General Mattis Didn\\u2019t do the job. I wasn\\u2019t happy with him. If you look at John Bolton, John Bolton, all he wanted to do is blow people up. He wanted to go to war with everybody. And frankly, I used him very nicely. I bring him into a room in a negotiation, when people saw them, they said, \\u201cOh wow, he\\u2019s going to go to war.\\u201d I\\u2019m bringing our troops back from Afghanistan. I\\u2019m bringing our troops back from Iraq. We\\u2019re almost out of almost every place. Everybody said because of my personality, they said, \\u201cHe\\u2019ll be in a war immediately.\\u201d Look at North Korea, how that\\u2019s worked out. The sanctions are on, everything\\u2019s the same, we haven\\u2019t spent anything. We\\u2019re getting along with him, I get along with Kim Jong-un.\\nDonald Trump: (57:36)\\nThat was supposed to be a war. If President Obama were president, if Hillary Clinton ever got in, that would be a war. We would have a war, probably a nuclear war with North Korea. In the meantime, I\\u2019m getting calls all the time from friends of mine in South Korea. \\u201cThank you. We love you. Thank you.\\u201d It\\u2019s really been rather amazing. So instead of wars, everybody said, look at what we had today with the United Arab Emirates, UAE, and just take a look at what happened with Israel today with that. Take a look at what\\u2019s going on. That was going to be a problem. We\\u2019re actually creating peace in the Middle East without blood staining our sand. Look at what happened with Bahrain-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (58:18)\\nYou\\u2019ve criticized Jim Mattis.\\nDonald Trump: (58:19)\\nGeorge, look at what happened with Bahrain. Well, a guy like Jim Mattis would have disagreed with the way I went about it, and I\\u2019ve turned out to be correct. Tom Friedman of the New York Times wrote incredible glowing articles last week about this incredible thing that I\\u2019ve been able to do in the Middle East. A guy like Jim Mattis could have never done it because they were all doing it the old fashioned way. They were going in the wrong outlets and the wrong doors. And what happened today with the UAE, and with Bahrain, and with Israel, people don\\u2019t even believe it. And George, as sure as you\\u2019re sitting there, I have numerous other countries in that region that are going to be signing very soon also. You\\u2019ll have peace in the Middle East, and this is without war and without losing, and I\\u2019m talking about on both sides, but without losing our great young soldiers.\\nDonald Trump: (59:09)\\nI go to Dover and I greet oftentimes soldiers coming in, and they\\u2019re dead. And there\\u2019s no sadder thing than to sit with a widow or a mother and watch these big, massive cargo planes, and that back opens up and these incredible Marines are walking off a casket and they were killed in the Middle East. And in many ways, nobody even knows why. Going there was the worst decision in the history of our country. We\\u2019ve spent $8 trillion and we\\u2019ve lost thousands of lives, but really millions of lives because I view both sides. Okay? If that\\u2019s okay. Millions of lives, this was the worst decision. And by the way, Iraq did not\\u2026 Saddam Hussein did not knock down the World Trade Center in case you don\\u2019t know, and I\\u2019m sure you do know that. They said they had weapons of mass destruction, they made a mistake. So we\\u2019re now $8 trillion. We\\u2019ve been in there for 20 years, almost 20 years in Afghanistan. I guess it\\u2019s getting very close to that, it\\u2019s over 19 and we\\u2019re bringing our soldiers back home.\\nDonald Trump: (01:00:18)\\nNobody expected that from me and people are so happy about it. And you know who\\u2019s the happiest? The soldiers. I see them all the time. \\u201cWhat do you think? Should we be here?\\u201d \\u201cNo, sir. You shouldn\\u2019t be here.\\u201d \\u201cWhy?\\u201d \\u201cThey don\\u2019t like us, sir.\\u201d And I\\u2019ll tell you what, I\\u2019ve rarely met a soldier that\\u2019s over there. They\\u2019re better than anybody because they can tell you better than anybody what\\u2019s happening. Rarely do I meet a soldier that says we should be there. It was the worst mistake, the most costly mistake in the history of our country, going into the Middle East.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:00:45)\\nGoing to be right back.\\nCommercial: (01:00:53)\\nThe right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. 2020, The President and The People will return in a moment. The President and The People, a special edition of 2020. Here again, George Stephanopoulos.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:06:03)\\nWelcome back to our Town meeting with President Trump. The next question comes from Alexander J. Floyd of Dallas, Pennsylvania. He voted for President Trump last time around.\\nAlexander: (01:06:12)\\nHello Mr. Trump. My question is actually about police reform. And how can we balance common sense police reform without sacrificing public safety in a time when part of the country is calling to defund the police and actively cheering when they\\u2019re gunned down in the street, and another part is tired of seeing the lawlessness?\\nDonald Trump: (01:06:30)\\nSo we have a great Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina, and he had a plan that was very much of a compromise plan, but it was a plan that everybody pretty much agreed to. A lot of Democrats agreed to it, but they wouldn\\u2019t vote for it. And it was a really good, it was a compromise of a lot of different factors, and it didn\\u2019t get done, and it should have gotten done and it could still be out there, it could still be resurrected very easily, but they just didn\\u2019t want to do it. Because I think the Democrats are viewing this as a political issue, and I probably agree with them. I think it\\u2019s very bad for them because we\\u2019re about law and order, we have to be about law and order. Otherwise you\\u2019re going to see your cities burn and that\\u2019s the way it is.\\nDonald Trump: (01:07:10)\\nIf we can do a plan like Tim Scott\\u2019s plan, which is really, it goes far enough, but it doesn\\u2019t take the dignity away from our police. We have incredible people. They\\u2019ve been protecting us for a long time. I mean, we are here, and I feel very safe being in this room. These are great people. We can\\u2019t take their dignity away. We have to let them be able to do what they do better than anybody else. So I think we have to look at it that way. We have to be very, very careful. Police are so afraid today, that they do something slightly wrong, slightly wrong, and their pension\\u2019s gone, their job\\u2019s gone, who knows what happens? Their life is ruined, their wife or their husband will leave, the whole thing, it\\u2019s a very scary thing to do.\\nDonald Trump: (01:07:52)\\nAnd then you look at safety. I mean, you look at that horrible human being that shot these two police, [inaudible 01:07:59] right next, just a disgusting and then ran off. You look at that. This is a very tough job and it\\u2019s a very unsafe job. It\\u2019s a very dangerous job. We have to give them back their dignity and we have to give them back respect. These are great people, for the most part. There\\u2019s always going to be a bad apple in your business, in my business, no matter what. I mean, there\\u2019s going to be bad apples so we have to weed out the bad apples, but we have to give the police back that strength that they had a short while ago and that they have in Republican cities, frankly, and states. But you take a look, this is a Democrat problem.\\nDonald Trump: (01:08:39)\\nGeorge, I know you\\u2019re a Democrat, but this is largely a Democrat problem. If you just take a look at the list, every Democrat city, almost, not all, but a lot of them certainly in the top 25, even if you go to the top 50, almost every city is run by the Democrats. People don\\u2019t respect our police and they have to respect them-\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:09:02)\\nMr.President, you promised four years ago-\\nDonald Trump: (01:09:02)\\nRespect our police.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:09:02)\\nMr. President.\\nDonald Trump: (01:09:02)\\nAnd they have to respect them.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:09:02)\\nYou promised four years ago at the Republican Convention, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to restore law and order in this country-\\u201d\\nDonald Trump: (01:09:08)\\nAnd I have, except in Democrat-run cities. Look, we have laws. We have to go by the laws. We can\\u2019t move in the National Guard. I can call insurrection, but there\\u2019s no reason to ever do that. Even in a Portland case. We can\\u2019t call in the National Guard unless we\\u2019re requested by a governor. If a governor or a mayor is a Democrat, like in Portland, we call them constantly. I just spoke to the governor yesterday, because we\\u2019re giving them relief from the fires. We\\u2019re giving them an emergency declaration. I said, \\u201cGovernor, let us go in and we\\u2019ll clean up Portland so fast. In a half an hour, it\\u2019ll be all right.\\u201d And she\\u2019s just torn by it. I don\\u2019t understand the thinking, but they are torn by it. I have a lot of respect for the governor, frankly, and what happened in Minneapolis was pretty amazing.\\nDonald Trump: (01:09:56)\\nUnfortunately, it just went on for a week or a week and a half before he allowed us to bring in the National Guard. When we brought in the National Guard, everything stopped, the crime was gone, meaning the whole thing. But by that time, a big portion of the city was burned down. We\\u2019re talking about Minneapolis. In Seattle, we let them know we\\u2019re coming in. They took over a big chunk of the city, 20% of the city. We said, \\u201cWe\\u2019re coming in.\\u201d As soon as we said that the police department went in and these other people were exhausted, but had we not said we\\u2019re going in, we were ready to go in, we were going in the following morning, wherever you have a Democrat city, not in all cases, but if you look at the really troubled cities in our country, they\\u2019re Democrat-run and that\\u2019s Biden.\\nDonald Trump: (01:10:43)\\nThey\\u2019re weak, they\\u2019re ineffective.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:10:45)\\nMr. President, you\\u2019re president for those cities right now.\\nDonald Trump: (01:10:47)\\nI\\u2019m president, but I can only do what I\\u2019m allowed to do. George. I don\\u2019t need insurrection. I don\\u2019t need an insurrection act to take care of 250 anarchists. We can do that very easily with the National Guard. We proved that in Minneapolis. They came in after the city was burning. And the thing I don\\u2019t really get is that the news media is saying, \\u201cNo, these are peaceful. These are peaceful.\\u201d And right over the reporter, it was a CNN reporter, right over his shoulder, and you saw that, right over his shoulder, the city is burning. It looked like it was Berlin during the war. It was the craziest thing I\\u2019ve ever seen, and he\\u2019s trying to say, I don\\u2019t know why the news media tries to make so light of it. These are not protests. These are far greater than protests.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:11:32)\\nGot to take another quick break.\\nCommercial: (01:11:38)\\nNo person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice. 2020, The President and The People will return after this.\\nCommercial: (01:16:32)\\nFrom the Constitution Center in Philadelphia, here again, George Stephanopoulos.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:16:37)\\nWelcome back to our Town meeting with President Trump. We\\u2019re taking questions. Pennsylvania voters have not made up their minds this election. Next one comes from Flor Cruceta. She\\u2019s from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. She has not voted before because she just became a citizen.\\nDonald Trump: (01:16:50)\\nOh, very good.\\nFlor Cruceta: (01:16:52)\\nThank you so much. Hi, Mr. President.\\nDonald Trump: (01:16:54)\\nThank you.\\nFlor Cruceta: (01:16:55)\\nMr. George. Hi everyone. My name is Flor Cruceta. Sorry if I can\\u2019t hold my tears. [crosstalk 01:17:02] I came in 2006 with my mom from Dominican Republic. Sorry.\\nDonald Trump: (01:17:20)\\nThat\\u2019s all right. And just take your time. That\\u2019s fine. George has plenty of time. I hope, right?\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:17:25)\\nAbsolutely.\\nDonald Trump: (01:17:25)\\nThank you. Did you say your mom got COVID?\\nFlor Cruceta: (01:17:27)\\nWe come from Dominican Republic in 2006 to live our American dream. But she forget how to take care of herself, and she died last month. Sorry.\\nDonald Trump: (01:17:49)\\nTerrible. And that\\u2019s okay. It\\u2019s okay.\\nFlor Cruceta: (01:17:56)\\nShe have breast cancer, but it made metastasized on her brain, bone, and lungs. And she passed on the 19. One of her biggest dream was to become a citizen to vote and she did. She did it 10 days before she died and I did it too. She pushed me so hard to do it and I did it this past 28. I\\u2019m here because of her. She was supposed to be here and ask you and thank you for the [inaudible 01:18:29] you take during this epidemic. You made people closer. We lost our job but we learn how to love our family. So I\\u2019m saying that from her.\\nDonald Trump: (01:18:41)\\nVery nice.\\nFlor Cruceta: (01:18:46)\\nHere\\u2019s a question for you both because she write this question. What will you do for our immigration system? What would you change to make more people like me and like her to become citizen and vote?\\nDonald Trump: (01:19:02)\\nSo, we are doing something with immigration that I think is going to be very strong because we want people to come into our country, people like you and like your mother, and that just shows how vicious the COVID is, especially when you have another problem, you have a heart problem or another type of a problem. And it\\u2019s a very sad story, but we want people to come into our country. We want them to come in, a lot of people, but we want them to come in through a legal system, through a system that they love our country, they work to come into our country, a merit system, and we\\u2019re working on something very hard right now and in a very short time, we\\u2019re going to be announcing it. And I think it\\u2019s going to have quite an impact. I think it\\u2019s going to be something that actually will be popular for all.\\nDonald Trump: (01:19:48)\\nI mean, as far as your situation with your mother, that is just devastating. Because I can imagine how you feel and sounds like a great woman, and I\\u2019ll tell you, I\\u2019m pretty good with people. She gave us a great daughter, a great child. What she\\u2019s done with you, the way you are, the love that you have for your mother, I can see that. It\\u2019s hard, and so many people, and they die alone. They die alone because this is such a vicious thing. You can\\u2019t go there and hold their hand. You can\\u2019t give them a kiss goodnight. It\\u2019s a terrible, terrible thing. And hopefully the vaccines are going to be very soon. Hopefully. Did you have COVID? You didn\\u2019t have it, right?\\nFlor Cruceta: (01:20:26)\\nNo.\\nDonald Trump: (01:20:26)\\nYou didn\\u2019t have it, mother. We\\u2019ll have it taken care of. It\\u2019s going to get taken care of. The vaccines are going to make a big difference. What has made a big difference is Remdesevir. We have many things now and things are going to be announced soon, which frankly, if you take a look at some of the things we\\u2019re doing in terms of the word wouldn\\u2019t be cure, but the word would be therapeutically or therapeutics, we have some incredible things which is so important. And I view that actually in a certain way is more important than the vaccine where you can go into a hospital and get your mother and give her a transfusion or a shot and they can get better, get better much faster. So we have some of those things and they\\u2019ve been very, very successful, but we have others coming out and in order to get them, we had to get the FDA to approve these products, these very sophisticated medicines, I guess you could call them medicine, but we had to get them approved very quickly and they did it.\\nDonald Trump: (01:21:25)\\nDr. Hahn, the head of the FDA, Alex Azar, they\\u2019ve really done a fantastic job. I believe George that none of this would have happened in another administration. And I think you know that. The FDA is approving things at a level that they\\u2019ve never done and at speed with which they\\u2019ve never acted before.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:21:44)\\nBig question is, is it being done safely? We\\u2019ve got to take a another break. We\\u2019re going to be right back [crosstalk 01:21:47].\\nCommercial: (01:21:52)\\nThe right of citizens of the United States who are 18 years of age or older to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of age.\\nCommercial: (01:22:06)\\nThis special edition of 2020 will return in a moment. The President and The People, a special edition of 2020. Here again, George Stephanopoulos.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:27:12)\\nWelcome back to our town meeting. We have time for one final question that comes from Ashley West of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.\\nAshley West: (01:27:17)\\nHi Mr. Trump.\\nDonald Trump: (01:27:19)\\nHi Ashley.\\nAshley West: (01:27:21)\\nSorry. My question is, what has been the most difficult part of your presidency and what have you learned from it?\\nDonald Trump: (01:27:29)\\nSo I think without question, I would say, because things were going so well, I think I\\u2019d have to say the whole COVID, the China virus as I call it because it comes from China so I think it\\u2019s a much more accurate term. But it\\u2019s been very difficult, it\\u2019s been so sad. As an example, talking to you about your mother, it\\u2019s just such a sad situation. Yeah, we\\u2019re getting there, we will get there, we\\u2019re going to, it\\u2019s going to happen, but it\\u2019s been very difficult, nobody\\u2019s seen anything like this probably since 1970 [inaudible 01:28:03].\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:28:04)\\nWhat did you learn from it?\\nDonald Trump: (01:28:07)\\nI learned that life is very fragile. I knew people that were powerful people, strong people, good people, and they got knocked out by this and died. Six people. It was five until about two weeks ago, now it\\u2019s six. But I\\u2019ve learned that life is very fragile because these were strong people and all of a sudden they were dead, they were gone, and it wasn\\u2019t their fault. It was the fault of a country that could have stopped it. And I made a great trade deal with China,\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:28:39)\\nAny of it was your fault?\\nDonald Trump: (01:28:41)\\nI feel so differently about that deal now. It\\u2019s a great deal. It was good for the farmers, good for the manufacturers, but I don\\u2019t view it the same way. It was good for us, but I don\\u2019t view it the same way because of the horror of this disease that really could have been stopped at the border.\\nGeorge Stephanopoulos: (01:28:57)\\nCould you have done more to stop it?\\nDonald Trump: (01:28:59)\\nI don\\u2019t think so. I think what I did by closing up the country, I think I saved two, maybe two and a half, maybe more than that lives. I really don\\u2019t think so. I think we did a very good job. I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s been recognized. We\\u2019ve made a lot of governors feel good. We\\u2019ve made some, reputationally. We\\u2019ve enhanced their reputation. They didn\\u2019t have anything, we got them the supplies, we got them the ventilators.

He just can\\u2019t relate in any way.\\nPresident Obama: (00:26)\\nWell, and one of the things that I have always known about you, Joe, it\\u2019s the reason why I wanted you to be my vice president and the reason why you were so effective. And it all starts with being able to relate. If you can sit down with a family and see your own family in them and the struggles that you\\u2019ve gone through, or your parents went through, or your kids are going through. If you can connect those struggles to somebody else\\u2019s struggles, then you\\u2019re going to work hard for them. And that\\u2019s always what\\u2019s motivated you to get into public service.\\nPresident Obama: (01:06)\\nWhen we came in to office, even before inauguration, we had seen a historic financial crisis. Irresponsibility on Wall Street had spread out to main street. We had to move fast, not just in 100 days, we had to move in the first month to get the Recovery Act passed. We\\u2019re now in a situation where not only we\\u2019ve got a economic crisis, but we also have a public health crisis to boot. Tell me a little bit about how you\\u2019re seeing the current economic crisis and how you\\u2019re thinking about the economy right now.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (01:45)\\nWell, Mr. President, there\\u2019s three pieces that I see. One, we have got to sustain and keep people from going under forever. There\\u2019s already 10,000 businesses are not likely to open again, a significant number of them small business and minority businesses. Number two, when they\\u2019re able to come back, they not only are able to keep their folks employed on a payroll, but they\\u2019re able to cover overhead. They\\u2019re able to cover the additional expenses. For example, the idea you can open without social distancing, masks, tests and all these things, that cost a lot of money.\\nPresident Obama: (02:20)\\nThose are added cost for small businesses.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (02:21)\\nThey\\u2019re added costs and they should be able to have that added cost to be able to stay open for the good of the country. But the next stage of this is going to be, if the stimuluses can keep people afloat, then we have to deal with recovery. And the recovery is building back, but not just building back as you\\u2019ve been talking about, building back better. We have to change the way in which we deal with allowing people an opportunity to make a living. That includes childcare. That includes making significant investments in infrastructure so people can make, not a living wage, but a union wage, making sure we build up and entire new public health system and making sure everybody has healthcare. And, well, now we have a chance, we can add a public option now. But this guy\\u2019s in court in the middle of a pandemic trying to take away the protection for 100 million people who have preexisting conditions. I don\\u2019t think he has any sense of empathy. I don\\u2019t think he can associate at all.\\nPresident Obama: (03:30)\\nYou and I had experience dealing with health crises, public health crisis. And in each instance what you and I understood and why I have so much confidence that you\\u2019re going to be able to deal with COVID in the way that other countries with our kinds of resources are dealing with it right now, which is smartly. I have confidence that you\\u2019re going to actually listen to the experts and you\\u2019re going to pay attention to the science and you\\u2019re not going to quit on trying to actually bend down the curve of disease and transmission rates.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (04:18)\\nWhen we left office, you had set up a pandemic office within the White House. We had people from the CDC, 44 people in China. We knew pandemic diseases. This wasn\\u2019t going to be the only one that ever occurred.\\nPresident Obama: (04:31)\\nAnd the goal was to create an early warning system around the world by creating international cooperation so that when you saw it coming, you had time to prepare.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (04:42)\\nRight.\\nPresident Obama: (04:43)\\nI know how deeply you care about American families and that any loss of life that is preventable. If you\\u2019re president of the United States, it\\u2019s your job to try to prevent it. And one of the things that I think you said that\\u2019s so important and we understood this during the financial crisis, you can\\u2019t separate out the public health crisis from the economy. If you want the economy growing again, people have to feel safe.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (05:16)\\nWhat you did and what all great presidents do is not only lead, they persuade. I think what you did with Obamacare, the ACA, and what you wanted to do to have a public option. It\\u2019s the quickest, fastest way to get everyone covered. I remember when Beau was toward the end, and the only person I told the detail all the time as you, because you had a right to know exactly what\\u2026 and he only had months left to go. And I used to sit there and watch him in the bed and in pain and dying of glioblastoma. And I thought to myself, what would happen if his insurance company was able to come in, which they could have done before we passed Obamacare and said, \\u201cYou have out run your insurance. You\\u2019ve outlived it. Suffer the last five months of your life in peace. You\\u2019re on your own.\\u201d All the things that it did, that it was so profound an impact on people, it was like it took them a while until they started to take it away to realize what was happening.\\nPresident Obama: (06:29)\\nWell look, I mean, you and I both know what it\\u2019s like to have somebody you love get really sick and in some cases to lose somebody, but that loss is compounded when you see the stress on their faces because they\\u2019re worried that they\\u2019re being a burden on their families. They\\u2019re worried about whether the insurance is going to cover the treatments that they need. I couldn\\u2019t be prouder of what we got done. 20 million people have health insurance that didn\\u2019t have it because of what we did. But you remember when we were talking about this, I always used to say the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, it\\u2019s like a starter house. It\\u2019s the first house you get. And it\\u2019s not the end of the process, it\\u2019s the beginning of the process.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (07:32)\\nWe used to say that this is a starter house. Remember what I used to say, it\\u2019s like Social Security when it was first passed.\\nPresident Obama: (07:38)\\nThat\\u2019s exactly right.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (07:39)\\nSocial Security was first passed was this narrow.\\nPresident Obama: (07:42)\\nVery narrow.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (07:43)\\nSocial security now-\\nPresident Obama: (07:44)\\nAnd you kept on building it up.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (07:45)\\nKept building it up.\\nPresident Obama: (07:46)\\nMaking it better.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (07:47)\\nWell, that starter house, they got inside the house and they realized, wow, God, this is better than being out in the cold. That\\u2019s number one. But number two and then I said, but I got a guy out there banging down the house, they\\u2019re trying to take down the house. And I didn\\u2019t realize the reason I had this house and what\\u2019s happening now is that you have so many people now. I can\\u2019t think of any time since the flu in 1918, that the public had\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know then, but it appears, it had to be totally thoroughly aware of how vulnerable they were. Now, you have people going, \\u201cOh my Lord.\\u201d\\nPresident Obama: (08:30)\\nAnd look, you\\u2019re absolutely right that it is hard to fathom anybody wanting to take away people\\u2019s healthcare in the middle of a major public health crisis-\\nVice President Joe Biden: (08:43)\\nAnd offer nothing.\\nPresident Obama: (08:44)\\n\\u2026 and at a time when unemployment is in double digits. There\\u2019s another issue that\\u2019s been on our minds and was on our minds during my presidency and that is the issue of race in America and how communities of color are policed, how police are interacting and oftentimes acting in ways that are racially biased. And after the George Floyd tragedy, what we have seen is this extraordinary mobilization across the country of people of every walk of life, every race, every creed, who say, \\u201cWe\\u2019re past time to do something about this. We understand we\\u2019re not going to fix it all in one day, but we\\u2019re going to take this seriously and we\\u2019re going to start now.\\u201d And we had experiences with this during my administration. Our response was not to ignore those problems. Our response was we had a 21st Century Policing Task Force that we put together that drew police chiefs, academics, young members of Black Lives Matter all in a single conversation and we arrived at a series of recommendations that are still pertinent to this day.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (10:16)\\nWe got through the notion that if a police department was engaging in a practice and a pattern that was in violation of basic civil rights and civil liberties, the Justice Department of the United States of America, the federal government would intervene and stop it.\\nPresident Obama: (10:33)\\nRight.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (10:34)\\nWell, you authorized to put in place a whole range of things that would increase what most cops, the guys I grew up with became cops, firefighters or priests. I mean, I wasn\\u2019t qualified to do any one of them. The point was that they know they need more guidance.\\nPresident Obama: (10:52)\\nAnd I think this is a process that we\\u2019re all going through and we\\u2019re all learning. And something that I\\u2019ve always admired about you, Joe, is your willingness to listen and learn. It is a sign of leadership when you are willing to hear other people\\u2019s experiences. It has to do with communities that have systematically been under invested in. It has to do with hiring and the fact that or if you get on the phone, applying for a job, send in your resume, if your name is John, you might get called back, if your name\\u2019s Jamal, you might not.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (11:33)\\nIt\\u2019s about to be able to accumulate wealth. It\\u2019s about being able to be in a position. You know better than I do, but I\\u2019ve watched it my whole life working in the city, black entrepreneurs are as successful as white entrepreneurs given a shot in the same circumstance.\\nPresident Obama: (11:47)\\nWe\\u2019re in a moment right now, my daughters, your granddaughters have been involved in this moment-\\nVice President Joe Biden: (11:54)\\nBest friends.\\nPresident Obama: (11:54)\\n\\u2026in which this next generation\\u2019s saying, we have beliefs in all people being equal and we don\\u2019t see that operating out of there, we\\u2019re going to do something about it. And I think the key right now, and this is why I have so much confidence in your administration wanting to be a partner in harnessing that energy and bringing about concrete reforms, concrete steps, not just in the criminal justice system, not just with respect to policing, but also with respect to investment, jobs, business development, is going to send a signal of decency and regard and concern and community around the country. Because policy\\u2019s important, laws are important, budgets are important. But you know what\\u2019s important also is what kind of values are you communicating?\\nVice President Joe Biden: (13:00)\\nBingo.\\nPresident Obama: (13:01)\\nAnd if we want to create a world that we want our kids and grandkids to grow up in, then we\\u2019re going to have to do a whole lot better than we\\u2019re doing right now.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (13:11)\\nWe\\u2019ve got a hell of an opportunity.\\nPresident Obama: (13:12)\\nAnd everybody\\u2019s going to have to be involved.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (13:14)\\nWe\\u2019ve got a hell of an opportunity because look, what\\u2019s happened. You\\u2019ve got 70% of the American people saying we got to do something about this. I\\u2019m not just talking about the police.\\nPresident Obama: (13:23)\\nAnd that\\u2019s a big change from even when you and I-\\nVice President Joe Biden: (13:24)\\nIt\\u2019s a gigantic change. And let me tell you my thesis of why. There\\u2019s two ways in which presidents motivate people, by doing something really ennobling, important and people go, \\u201cOh.\\u201d Or to do something really bad. This guy has generated a sense out there that people are waking up to that he ran by deliberately dividing people from the moment he came down that escalator. And I think people are now going, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want my kid growing up that way.\\u201d\\nPresident Obama: (14:00)\\nYou know what it\\u2019s like as much as anybody to be in the White House during a crisis. You know what it\\u2019s like to have to get laws passed through Congress. You know what it\\u2019s like to deal with foreign leaders. You know what it\\u2019s like and how lonely it can be to make tough decisions where not every decision is going to be perfect, but you got to make them and to take responsibility for it. I\\u2019ve seen you with families that have gone through tragedies and the thing I\\u2019ve got confidence in, Joe, is your heart and your character and the fact that you are going to be able to reassemble the kind of government that cares about people and brings people together.\\nPresident Obama: (14:58)\\nAnd for all the specific policies that we\\u2019re going to need more than anything, it\\u2019s just that basic decency and an understanding about what\\u2019s best in America that I think people are going to be hungry for. Looking forward to working with you to do whatever I can to help. And I have confidence in your commitment to making sure that we seize this moment that we have right now.\\nVice President Joe Biden: (15:24)\\nThank you. And I have faith in the American people.\",\n          \"Karen Pence: (00:02)\\n100 years ago today, the 19th Amendment was adopted into the United States Constitution, guaranteeing women the right to vote. Because of heroes like Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone, women today, like our daughters Audrey and Charlotte, and future generations, will have their voices heard and their votes count. The women\\u2019s suffrage movement was the gateway that led to women having the opportunities to achieve monumental milestones and accomplish significant achievements in both civic and governmental roles.\\nKaren Pence: (00:41)\\nThis evening, we look at heroes in our land. As Second Lady of the United States for the past three and a half years, I have had the honor of meeting many heroes across this great country. The Pences are a military family. Our son Michael serves in the United States Marines, and our son-in-law Henry serves in the US Navy. One of my key initiatives is to elevate and encourage military spouses. These men and women, like our daughter Charlotte and our daughter-in-law Sarah, are the home front heroes.\\nKaren Pence: (01:22)\\nI have been privileged to hear so many stories of selfless support, volunteer spirit, and great contributions to the Armed Forces and our communities. Military spouses may experience frequent moves and job changes, periods of being a single parent while their loved one is deployed, all while exhibiting pride, strength, and determination, and being a part of something bigger than themselves. To all of the military spouses, thank you.\\nKaren Pence: (01:58)\\nPresident Trump and Vice President Pence have been supporting our United States Armed Forces, including our military families, on a significant scale. While traveling throughout our nation to educate military spouses about policy solutions that President Trump has promoted involving real, tangible progress in military spouse employment, I have been inspired to meet heroes like Lisa Bradley and Cameron Cruz. These military spouses decided to start their own business, R. Riveter, named after the Rosie the Riveter campaign used to recruit women workers during World War II. R. Riveter makes beautiful handbags designed and manufactured exclusively by military spouses. Many of those spouses live all over the country. They prepare and send their section of the bags to the company located in North Carolina, where the final product is assembled.\\nKaren Pence: (03:04)\\nMilitary spouse hero Jilan Hall-Johnson in Billings, Montana, is a culinary artist who had dreamed of starting her own restaurant. Working with the Small Business Administration\\u2019s Development Center, Jilan started her restaurant, The Sassy Biscuit. And she just opened a second restaurant in Dover, New Hampshire.\\nKaren Pence: (03:29)\\nAs the Second Lady, I\\u2019ve also been able to bring awareness to a form of therapy for our heroic veterans suffering from PTSD. Art therapy, facilitated by a professional art therapist, is especially effective with post-traumatic stress disorder. Master Gunnery Sergeant Chris Stowe, a Marine veteran I met in Tampa who deployed for combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, said nothing had helped him deal with the trauma from his service in the Marines until he finally agreed to meet with the art therapist at Walter Reed Medical Center. Chris credits art therapy with saving his marriage and his life. Chris went on to establish a glassblowing workshop to help other vets.\\nKaren Pence: (04:22)\\nMany of our veteran heroes struggle as they transition back into civilian life, and sometimes the stress is too difficult to manage alone. A few weeks ago, I had the honor of speaking with some amazing Americans who answer the Veteran\\u2019s Crisis Line. One in particular, Sidney Morgan, especially impacted me. A veteran herself, Sidney said it is the highest honor of her life, until they physically walk into a clinic to receive help they deserve, and she can pass their hand to someone ready to help.\\nKaren Pence: (05:03)\\nIn these difficult times, we\\u2019ve all seen so many examples of everyday Americans reaching out a hand to those in need, those who in humility have considered others more important than themselves. We\\u2019ve seen healthcare workers, teachers, first responders, mental health providers, law enforcement officers, grocery and delivery workers, and farmers, and so many others. Heroes all.\\nKaren Pence: (05:39)\\n100 years ago, women secured the right to vote. So let\\u2019s vote, America. Let\\u2019s honor our heroes. Let\\u2019s reelect President Trump and Vice President Pence for four more years. God bless our heroes, and God bless the United States of America.\",\n          \"Donald Trump: (00:00)\\nThank you very much. Thank you.\\nSpeaker 1: (00:00)\\nOklahoma loves you Mr. President.\\nDonald Trump: (00:29)\\nThank you very much.\\nSpeaker 3: (00:29)\\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.\\nDonald Trump: (00:29)\\nNow if you want to really drive them crazy, you say 12 more years.\\nSpeaker 3: (00:47)\\n12 more years. 12 more years.\\nDonald Trump: (00:51)\\nBecause we caught them doing some really bad things in 2016. Let\\u2019s see what happens. We caught them doing some really bad things. We have to be very careful because they\\u2019re trying it again with this whole 80 million mail-in ballots that they\\u2019re working on, sending them out to people that didn\\u2019t ask for them, they didn\\u2019t ask, they just get them and it\\u2019s not fair and it\\u2019s not right and it\\u2019s not going to be possible to tabulate in my opinion. It\\u2019s just my opinion. We have to be very, very careful, and you have to watch. Every one of you, you have to watch. Because bad things happened last time with the spying on our campaign and that goes to Biden and that goes to Obama and we have to be very, very careful. Have to be very, very careful, and this time they\\u2019re trying to do it with the whole Post Office scam. They\\u2019ll blame it on the Post Office. You can see them setting it up. Be very careful and watch it very carefully. Because we have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country. This is the most \\u2026 For a long period of time, I would say, \\u201cWell 2016, how special was that evening? Was that one of the great \\u2026\\u201d That was one of the great evenings but we have to be very, very careful and we have to win.\\nDonald Trump: (02:12)\\nOur country is counting on it. This is the biggest, this is it. Our country can go in a horrible, horrible direction or in an even greater direction and before the plague came in from China, that\\u2019s where we were going. We were going in a direction like we had never seen. The most successful economy in the history of our country, the best unemployment numbers in history for African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, women, college students, bad students, good students, everybody. If you had a diploma, if you didn\\u2019t have a diploma, didn\\u2019t matter, you were doing well. Everybody was doing well and we were actually coming together.\\nDonald Trump: (03:00)\\nYou know success brings people together, maybe better than anything else. Success brings people, so many times they say we\\u2019re divided. Well we were very divided under President Obama, very divided. People have no idea how divided. They didn\\u2019t talk about it as much, they didn\\u2019t say it as much, but we were really coming together and I was speaking with Democrats all of a sudden because the success, the markets were at an all-time high and by the way, take a look at what\\u2019s happening with the markets. Take a look at your 401(k)s which you probably do every hour. Take a look at your stocks. We\\u2019re very close to breaking the record and NASDAQ has already done it. You know NASDAQ has broken the record I think 16 times already during a pandemic. Hopefully we\\u2019ll call it the final phase of the pandemic.\\nDonald Trump: (03:55)\\nBiden the other day said no he\\u2019d shut it down. He\\u2019d listen to some guy say and he\\u2019d shut it down. We just broke a record on jobs, an all-time record. There\\u2019s never been three months where we\\u2019ve put more people to work, over nine million people, and again, we\\u2019re just about ready to break the all-time stock market record. I mean you look at it, we\\u2019re just about ready to do it again and what that means is everything else is going to follow. Very small on Wall Street. Everything else is going to be there, the economy is coming up very rapidly, our farmers are doing well. Our farmers are doing well because I got China to give them $28 billion because they were targeted by China. I got the farmers $28 billion, 16 and 12. That\\u2019s why. So in spite of the pandemic and our farmers did a great job in supplying food and all the difficulties during this period of time, but we\\u2019re getting ready to do things like nobody has ever seen before, but the best way to bring unity is success. Success brings unity and we were there, and then we got hit with the plague but we won\\u2019t forget that.\\nDonald Trump: (05:12)\\nI just want to thank the people of North Carolina because to be honest with you, I felt an obligation to be here. You have a governor is in a total shutdown mood. I guarantee you on November 4 it will all open up, it will be fine like most Southern states. On November 4, you know these Democrat governors, they love shutdown until after the election\\u2019s over because they want to make our numbers look as bad as possible for the economy but our numbers are looking so good and frankly I used to say a V and people would say, \\u201cWell maybe not. I don\\u2019t think so.\\u201d Some would say no way. We have a super V, you\\u2019re right. It\\u2019s now looking like it\\u2019s a super V. Our automobile numbers are incredible, both used cars and brand new cars, our manufacturing number is incredible. We\\u2019re putting a lot of manufacturing jobs to work that the previous administration said you\\u2019d need a magic wand. You\\u2019d need a magic wand for manufacturing jobs, I don\\u2019t think so. I guess we had the magic wand, that\\u2019s all, but again, we\\u2019re putting them back, we\\u2019re bringing them back. But think of your life just prior to the plague coming in. It was the best it\\u2019s ever been. Your state had the best numbers they\\u2019ve ever had, ever had, by far, and we had the best employment numbers also.\\nDonald Trump: (06:27)\\nWe were up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere near that, and then we had to shut it down. We saved millions and millions of lives. We learned the enemy, we learned all about the invisible enemy, how it affects really people that are older, especially older people, the elderly, but older people with problems with heart and diabetes, with other problems, and we learned and most of the country is right now doing very, very well. They\\u2019ve done an incredible job and to have a man sitting on television the other day say, \\u201cOh I\\u2019d shut it down. Oh I\\u2019d shut it.\\u201d Like it\\u2019s easy, shut it down. By the way, when you shut it down and we did the exact right thing, we shut it down, then we reopened and that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re doing now. We\\u2019re well into it, but \\u2026 If we didn\\u2019t shut it down at that point, we would have had millions of people dead. Millions of people.\\nDonald Trump: (07:29)\\nYou see the numbers, the job that Mike Pence and the taskforce and all of us together have done has been incredible, what we\\u2019ve done, what we\\u2019ve achieved, whether it\\u2019s ventilators, whether it\\u2019s supplying equipment to governors that were totally ill-prepared. Many of the governors were totally ill-prepared. Nobody wants to say that but it\\u2019s supposed to work that way, federalist, it\\u2019s supposed to work that way. The governors are supposed to do it, and many of them did a fine job and many of them came back well. But most of them didn\\u2019t have the equipment that they should have had. Few of them had the ventilators which are very, very complex machines and hard to make and hard to manufacture and expensive and we\\u2019re right now making thousands of ventilators a month and we\\u2019re sending them, we have all we can use, our whole country, every state. We\\u2019re stocked, we\\u2019re stocked and I always say and I\\u2019ll say it again, there\\u2019s never been a person that needed a ventilator that didn\\u2019t get a ventilator.\\nDonald Trump: (08:28)\\nEvery single person that\\u2019s ever needed a ventilator, with all that you\\u2019ve heard with how much they said we didn\\u2019t have again, I took over a country whose military was depleted and whose cupboard on this front were bare. The cupboards were bare. We didn\\u2019t have anything. We didn\\u2019t have a thing. We had very, very little and we did a great job. We haven\\u2019t been given \\u2026 And it\\u2019s not for me, it\\u2019s for the incredible people, the generals, the admirals, the doctors, the nurses and yet you saw yesterday convalescent plasma, you saw remdesivir. You\\u2019ll soon see vaccines pouring out years ahead of what they would have been under a more traditional, let\\u2019s use that term because it\\u2019s nicer, a more traditional administration where they would have taken years to come up with this stuff. We\\u2019re coming up with it like nobody\\u2019s ever seen before. The FDA, Dr. Hahn I want to thank him, Alex Azar, I want to thank him. They\\u2019ve come with things and done things that have never been done in terms of speed and frankly in terms of quality. If you look at it what we\\u2019re doing and what we\\u2019re coming up with, drug companies are coming up with vaccines that are \\u2026 I\\u2019ve seen some results already, it\\u2019s going to be very, very soon. They\\u2019re in Stage III trials. It\\u2019s unheard of. We wouldn\\u2019t be there for two years if this were a more normal situation.\\nDonald Trump: (10:02)\\nSo I just want to thank everybody for being here and again I felt an obligation to come to North Carolina. It\\u2019s been a place that\\u2019s been very good to me. You know we won a lot of victories here. I haven\\u2019t been doing this that long but I won every chance I had in North Carolina. I even stole a great chief of staff, Mark Meadows, right? I stole him from North Carolina, and he left Congress as a very popular guy. Could have been there for a long time if he wanted and he came in and by the way, you have a fantastic young gentleman going to take his place, he\\u2019s a fantastic young guy and he\\u2019s going to be a real star in the party. He\\u2019s going to be a real star in the party.\\nDonald Trump: (10:48)\\nSo I just want to thank everybody from North Carolina and I do want to show a little bit of a difference because another state that\\u2019s been very good to me is Wisconsin and Joe Biden was going to have their convention in Milwaukee and they didn\\u2019t go there at all, they didn\\u2019t do this. We did this out of respect for your state. We didn\\u2019t do this for any other reason other than respect for the state of North Carolina. Because we said we wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina and I think you\\u2019re going to remember that frankly on November 3. We wanted to hold our convention in North Carolina. So I did that out of respect, and if you had a governor that would have let us have some people. He actually told me this, we had an arena that holds 19,000 people, it was totally jammed, sold out, every hotel was full, everything, and I called him, he said, \\u201cBut we have a shutdown going on and according to the rules and regulations \\u2026\\u201d Now this is 19,000, he did say it. I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019ll deny it, but he said, \\u201cAccording to the rules and regulations, the most people you\\u2019re allowed to have in that room,\\u201d meaning that arena, he viewed it as a room, \\u201cIs 10 people.\\u201d\\nDonald Trump: (12:05)\\nI say, \\u201cSo Governor, so I\\u2019m at 19,000, you\\u2019re at 10. Can we work something in the middle.\\u201d It didn\\u2019t sound too good, so we really had no choice. It was a terrible thing but I felt so badly because you could have \\u2026 I mean economic development money, all of the things that happen, but we decided, I was with Ronna, the vice president, everybody, Mark, and we said let\\u2019s have our big deal, the roll call, let\\u2019s have it right here and let\\u2019s do it and I\\u2019m going to show up and I\\u2019m not going to tell anybody. Until a few minutes ago nobody knew I was coming. Nobody knew I was coming. But what\\u2019s more important than the roll call? You\\u2019re the ones calling it so what\\u2019s more important \\u2013\\nSpeaker 4: (12:52)\\nWe love you Mr. President. We love you.\\nDonald Trump: (12:52)\\nI have to tell you, we\\u2019re going to do a lot of things. I\\u2019m just going to go over very briefly because we\\u2019re going to make a speech on Thursday night, I hope you\\u2019re all going to be listening. Because I came in, I\\u2019m on Air Force One and Air Force One has more televisions that any plane in history. They\\u2019ve got them in closets, they\\u2019ve got them on ceilings, floors. They\\u2019ve got more \\u2026 You can\\u2019t escape a television, and I turned to CNN and they didn\\u2019t have this. They weren\\u2019t having it, can you believe it? They didn\\u2019t have it. No no, CNN didn\\u2019t have our roll call. Then I turned to MSDNC as I call it. MSDNC which is truly, it is a branch of the Democrats. It\\u2019s a I wouldn\\u2019t say fully owned corporation but it\\u2019s certainly a fully controlled or they control them, nobody really knows who\\u2019s controlling who but they had it on television. I remember watching it, it was interesting. You see the difference states and we say this and we say that, the great state of Alaska, the great state of Alabama, the great state of North Carolina, the great state of all of them, and it\\u2019s very interesting \\u2013\\nDonald Trump: (14:03)\\n\\u2026 Carolina. The great state of all of them. And it\\u2019s very interesting to me. They had theirs on, but they didn\\u2019t show it. Instead, they\\u2019re showing the scam because they\\u2019re trying to show the post office so that when their whole mail-in thing fizzles, they\\u2019ll try blaming it on the post office. Okay. So they show in these hearings that are very boring actually and they\\u2019re not showing you this either. They weren\\u2019t showing this. And Fox had it on, but unfortunately, Fox wasn\\u2019t showing it too much because they had the announcers talking, talking, talking. I said, \\u201d I want to hear what they\\u2019re saying, the delegates. I want to hear what they\\u2019re saying.\\u201d So I think we had to switch over to CSPAN or to OAN or somebody. But I wanted to hear them.\\nDonald Trump: (14:42)\\nBut I can promise you a few things. Number one, we will not be taking the word, God, out of The Pledge of Allegiance. Okay. Like they did a number of times at their caucuses, so they took the word God out. I heard it. I was listening and I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s strange.\\u201d It\\u2019s sort of weird. You\\u2019ve heard it all your life, right? Under God, under God. All of a sudden, those two words are missing. I said, \\u201cOh, he must\\u2019ve made a mistake.\\u201d Maybe the teleprompter wasn\\u2019t working or his book wasn\\u2019t working that I have right here. Something wasn\\u2019t working. I must admit. But the problem was then the next day I heard it again. And I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not a mistake.\\u201d And then they immediately went into a mode, \\u201cOh, no, no, no, no. We didn\\u2019t mean that. No, no. We didn\\u2019t say if for the convention. We didn\\u2019t say it.\\u201d No, that\\u2019s where they\\u2019re coming from. That\\u2019s where they\\u2019re coming from. You can say it or not say it. That is where they\\u2019re coming from.\\nDonald Trump: (15:48)\\nJust like with energy, they don\\u2019t want energy. Not working well in Texas, by the way. I just looked at a poll. And by the way, it just came out that we have received 51% in the big and very important Rasmussen poll, and my numbers actually went up during the Democratic National Convention, 51%. So, think of it.\\nAudience: (16:10)\\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.\\nDonald Trump: (16:14)\\nThank you.\\nAudience: (16:14)\\nFour more years.\\nDonald Trump: (16:14)\\nI love this state.\\nAudience: (16:14)\\nFour more years.\\nDonald Trump: (16:14)\\nThink of it-\\nAudience: (16:14)\\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.\\nDonald Trump: (16:14)\\nThank you.\\nAudience: (16:14)\\nFour more years.\\nDonald Trump: (16:29)\\nI love this state. I like this place and you\\u2019re from all over the place. But this has been a good one for me. No, but think of it, so we\\u2019re at 51% in Rasmussen. Do you read about it? Do you hear about it?. You don\\u2019t hear about it. They give you these suppression polls, where they do registered voters instead of most likely. It\\u2019s supposed to be likely, likely. In other words, how about you, you\\u2019re likely to vote. But how about you, you\\u2019re registered, but I\\u2019m not voting. But see, under their plan where they send these ballots, you don\\u2019t have to want to vote. You get the ballot and then they have harvesting. They get guys to go, \\u201cDo you want to vote?\\u201d \\u201cNo, not really, but I have a ballot.\\u201d \\u201cAll right, good. Who\\u2019s it for?\\u201d \\u201cSleepy Joe Biden.\\u201d \\u201cNow put it here, sign. Okay. Could I have it?\\u201d And they\\u2019ll take it.\\nDonald Trump: (17:15)\\nIn fact, harvesting is illegal in your state. They wanted to put a Republican, a fine man, a pastor, they wanted to put them in jail because he harvested. Now they want to make harvesting legal all of a sudden. They\\u2019ll put him in jail as a Republican, right? If he was a Democrat, they wouldn\\u2019t even be thinking about it. In California, they do the same thing. No repercussion. In North Carolina, you had a fine pastor, a fine man, and they got him on harvesting and they wanted to put them in jail. And now they want to make it all so that everybody can harvest because they know it\\u2019s not a good thing.\\nDonald Trump: (17:53)\\nSo people that don\\u2019t want to vote are going to be sitting there, there\\u2019ll be making them \\u2026 If you talk about 80 million ballots, it\\u2019s 80 million, it could even be higher than that. I used to say 51 million, now it\\u2019s 80 million. They said, \\u201cSir, you\\u2019re a little obsolete with the 50.\\u201d I said, \\u201cAll right, what is it?\\u201d \\u201c80.\\u201d I said, \\u201c80.\\u201d How is it possible? Think of it, they\\u2019ll be sending them, they\\u2019ll be dumping them in neighborhoods. People are going to be picking them up. They\\u2019ll be bribing. They\\u2019ll be paying off people to grab some. This is going to be one of the greatest scams. And it\\u2019s common sense. This has nothing to do with politics. It\\u2019s common sense. Anybody, you don\\u2019t have to know politics, they\\u2019re going to mail out 80 million ballots. It\\u2019s impossible. They have no idea.\\nDonald Trump: (18:36)\\nWho\\u2019s mailing them? Mostly Democrat states and Democrat governors. Well, supposing they don\\u2019t mail them to Republican neighborhoods. That means they\\u2019re not going to get them. So they\\u2019re going to complain and the election\\u2019s going to be over. And then they\\u2019re going to complain. And then they\\u2019ll say, \\u201cOh, well, we didn\\u2019t get it. Big deal.\\u201d In the meantime, you might lose the election. This is the greatest scam in the history of politics, I think, and I\\u2019m talking about beyond our nation. And they act like they\\u2019re aggrieved. Like by saying this, we\\u2019re saying such a horrible thing. We\\u2019re not patriotic by saying this. No, we voted during World War I. We voted at the voting booth during World War II. The pandemic, we\\u2019re doing very well and people know how to handle it. Look at the crowds. They\\u2019re doing very well. It\\u2019s very safe. It\\u2019s going to be very safe. If you have an absentee ballot where you request it, we\\u2019re all in favor of that. Absentee, like in Florida, they have absentee is good.\\nDonald Trump: (19:40)\\nBut other than that, they\\u2019re very, very bad. There\\u2019ll be millions of ballots. Take a look at New York, take a look at Virginia, take a look at New Jersey, all different cases. They just had one last night. Now they\\u2019re thinking about recalling certain elections that took place with mail-in, and these are small elections that are locally based that are easy to run, not millions, but thousands of ballots, thousands, hundreds of ballots. But these are small, and they can\\u2019t control it. They said 23% of the ballots were defective. What does defective mean? It means fraud. It means a lot of things that we won\\u2019t get into because I don\\u2019t want to be accused. You see all the cameras back there. It\\u2019s the fake news. I don\\u2019t want to be accused of anything. But what it means is they\\u2019re trying to steal the election from the Republicans, that\\u2019s what it means. In a very, very nice way, I will tell you they are trying to steal the election just like they did it last time with spying and we caught them, and that included President Obama and that included-\\nAudience: (20:46)\\nSpygate.\\nDonald Trump: (20:46)\\nLet\\u2019s be nice. Biden. This could only happen in North Carolina. But that included them and they got caught. And then somebody said, \\u201cWell, what are you going to do?\\u201d \\u201d Well, we can attack a president.\\u201d Oh, I see. If it was me \\u2026 They say we can\\u2019t attack a president. We caught him. We caught him cold and they say, we can\\u2019t attack. He was at meetings talking about it. And by the way, this was spying before and after. And I think it\\u2019s a disgrace to our country. I think we can never let that happen again. But now they\\u2019re doing something that in a certain way is more dangerous because it\\u2019s more effective. They spied on my campaign, you know what they found, nothing. But this is big stuff. This is stealing millions of votes. And it\\u2019s going to be very hard.\\nDonald Trump: (21:41)\\nNow we\\u2019re in courts all over the country. And hopefully, we have judges that are going to give it a fair call because if they give it a fair call, we\\u2019re going to win this election. The only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election. We\\u2019re going to win this election.\\nAudience: (21:57)\\nThat\\u2019s right.\\nDonald Trump: (21:57)\\nWe\\u2019re going to win this election.\\nAudience: (21:57)\\nFour more years. Four more years. Four more years.\\nDonald Trump: (22:07)\\nI\\u2019m just saying we cannot have these live, we call them live, some people call them universal, I like the word live, these live mail-in ballots sent to everybody, including mostly people that never asked for them. Think of it. You\\u2019re sitting there, you get a ballot. Here\\u2019s the bottom line. It was just given that in the polls believe it or not because the polls try and treat us right. That\\u2019s why I respect Rasmussen because they did well. A few of the others feel the same way, and they did well last time. Those are the ones that I look at. The ones that did well last time and Rasmussen was very good.\\nDonald Trump: (22:41)\\nBut if you look at it, every single vote that they have, every single vote it\\u2019s going to be looked at. A man is sitting, or a woman is sitting, waiting for nothing, watching television, has no enthusiasm. Because on enthusiasm, the polls are saying that I\\u2019m up by massive numbers, not just a little. I\\u2019m also way up on the economy, by the way, put at the top. Way, way up. But I\\u2019m up by massive, and when I say I\\u2019m up, I\\u2019m talking about we\\u2019re up. Okay. So if you could [inaudible 00:23:10].\\nAudience: (23:10)\\nWe love you.\\nDonald Trump: (23:11)\\nBut I\\u2019m up by massive numbers on enthusiasm. So our voters are saying, \\u201cI\\u2019m very angry about this. I\\u2019ll go to the poll directly and vote.\\u201d But that vote is the saying, \\u201cI don\\u2019t care if Biden gets in.\\u201d He doesn\\u2019t have any enthusiasm. When you go to Ohio, when you go to Wisconsin, when you go to North Carolina, when you go to a lot of states, they have the Trump-Pence sign on every lawn. It\\u2019s all over the place, right? It\\u2019s all over.\\nAudience: (23:37)\\nIndiana wants you.\\nDonald Trump: (23:39)\\nIndiana too. Indiana is great. Bobby Knight. We love Bobby Knight too. I\\u2019ll tell you, we love Bobby Knight and Coach Oates and all of them. They love us. And we love them. Indiana is great. Thank you. But here\\u2019s the thing. So if they don\\u2019t have any enthusiasm, so you\\u2019d say, \\u201cAre you going to vote?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not getting up to vote.\\u201d Okay. \\u201cI want to watch television instead of vote.\\u201d All right. But here\\u2019s a ballot. It just got to you. And he opens it. Oh, here\\u2019s a ballet. What the hell am I going to do with this thing? And then they have somebody knocking on your door and they\\u2019re harvesting. \\u201cHey, have you gotten your ballot?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, I have my ballot.\\u201d \\u201cYou going to sign it?\\u201d \\u201cWell, if you want, I\\u2019ll sign it. Here it is. Get out of here.\\u201d That\\u2019s the most honest way of doing it, and that\\u2019s unfair.\\nDonald Trump: (24:24)\\nThat\\u2019s unfair because now they\\u2019re taking all of that enthusiasm that our party has, and we have tremendous enthusiasm. I think we have record enthusiasm. We have a base the likes of which nobody\\u2019s seen, including these people. Wall Street Journal did a fantastic story this weekend, a fantastic cover story this weekend on the base. It\\u2019s an incredible base. Everybody here is going to vote everybody in our base. I mean, we have a tremendous base. They don\\u2019t. They have no enthusiasm for their candidate. Because frankly, Bernie Sanders, they have much more enthusiasm for him. But Bernie Sanders, excuse me, again, he\\u2019s the greatest loser I\\u2019ve ever seen. This guy can lose and be so happy. Hillary Clinton, I want to use nice language so I don\\u2019t want to a use certain word. It starts with the word S-C. I don\\u2019t want to use it because they\\u2019ll say he used foul language while in North Carolina. So I won\\u2019t do that.\\nDonald Trump: (25:25)\\nBut Bernie Sanders got taken advantage of, is that okay, by Hillary Clinton, but worse by the Democrats this time because of Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren got out of the campaign one day prior to the Super Tuesday vote, Bernie Sanders would have won every single state because Biden won by a little bit. She didn\\u2019t do well, but she took thousands and thousands of votes away and he stayed. If you add just a percentage of those votes back, that means that Bernie would have won easily the nomination. And I\\u2019m glad he didn\\u2019t because he had much more enthusiasm. And he would have had a base, a much smaller base than ours, but equally, I have to say this, equally as enthusiastic. This base doesn\\u2019t like Joe Biden. They don\\u2019t like Joe Biden. I think we\\u2019re going to get a lot of votes. We did last time. People were surprised. Primarily because of trade because I know how other countries take advantage of us, and I understand that, and that\\u2019s something that Bernie Sanders people really feel because I understand trade. I\\u2019ve done USMCA now. I got rid of NAFTA, the world\\u2019s worst [inaudible 00:26:33].\\nAudience: (26:31)\\nThank you, Mr. President.\\nDonald Trump: (26:36)\\nChina tariffs. I mean, China had the worst year they\\u2019ve had in 67 years prior to the plague. The worst year they\\u2019ve had in decades and decades and we had the best year we\\u2019ve ever had. But we took in billions from China. We never took in 25 cents from China, never took in 25 cents. China for 25 years, and not only Obama, for 25 years China was taken in anywhere between 200 billion with a B and $550 billion from the United States.\\nDonald Trump: (27:08)\\nI give them all the credit, number one for being smart and outfoxing all of the people that stood here and their representatives, but China, we built China. We helped build. We gave them three, four, $500 billion a year because before that, and before the World Trade Organization and they getting into it, China was flat line. China was \\u2026 It was after that happened. And then they took advantage of us because we didn\\u2019t have people that were smart enough to see. And by the way, Biden would be the worst of all of them because his son took out one and a half billion dollars and he gets fees on one and a half billion, which is millions of dollars a year. Give me a break. China will own our country if this guy gets elected. We can\\u2019t let it happen. We can\\u2019t let it happen.\\nAudience: (27:56)\\nThat\\u2019s right. Stop that. Drain the swamp.\\nDonald Trump: (28:02)\\nSo, we have a big one coming.\\nDonald Trump: (28:03)\\n\\u2026 So we have a big one coming. And just to finish, enthusiasm. So they take the enthusiasm now out of the equation, because they\\u2019re going to go knock on everybody\\u2019s door. Here, would you sign this? Yeah, I\\u2019ll sign it. Nobody knows who the hell is signing it. And they now want to have it where the signature doesn\\u2019t have to be verified. That\\u2019s right. The signature doesn\\u2019t have to be verified. And then they\\u2019re going to play the game that we\\u2019re not patriotic. What they\\u2019re doing is using COVID to steal an election. They\\u2019re using COVID to defraud the American people, all of our people, of a fair and free election. And we can\\u2019t do that. And don\\u2019t let them give you the Post Office stuff. The Postal Service, they do a great job. Lose a lot of money. I\\u2019ve said if they charged Amazon and these companies doing that, a couple of dollars more a package, that Amazon has to pay, not the customer.\\nDonald Trump: (29:03)\\nYou know what happened? Post Office would start doing very well, thank you. Amazon dumps all the packages. Why should we deliver it? We\\u2019ll let the Post Office do it and lose a fortune. So if they charged Amazon, now of course, he owns the Washington Post. So when I get bad stories in the Washington Post, I wonder why, right? I wonder why. But I just tell it like it is, right? I tell it like it is. We\\u2019ve accomplished more. We\\u2019ve accomplished more during the first three and a half years of this administration than any president in the history of our country. And I\\u2019m not even getting push back. I\\u2019ve been saying this for two years, for three years, I used to say for two years, for three years. But we\\u2019ve done more, let\\u2019s say just about. This way they can\\u2019t say, \\u201cWell, somebody won a war, or something.\\u201d Right? No, no. We\\u2019ve accomplished more than just about any administration in the history of our country. We\\u2019ve secured our borders.\\nDonald Trump: (30:06)\\nWe\\u2019ve built our wall, which will be finished very shortly. We brought back manufacturing jobs. We\\u2019ve defeated the entire\\u2026 Defeated the ISIS caliphate and killed al-Baghdadi. We also killed the greatest, biggest terrorist maybe of them all, Soleimani. We killed Soleimani, right? And al-Baghdadi. We appointed 300 new judges. By the end of the first term, we will have appointed 300. It\\u2019s an unheard of number. That\\u2019s because president Obama was very nice and he gave me 142 openings. And historically, you get no open. When you become president. First question, you say, \\u201cHow many judges?\\u201d They\\u2019ll say, \\u201cNone, sir.\\u201d Because the other previous president, they want to\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very important thing, federal judges.\\nDonald Trump: (31:03)\\nWe will have appointed 300, could be even more than that by the end of the first term. And I sat down, I said, first day, I said, \\u201cHow many judges do I get to appoint?\\u201d They said, \\u201cSir, 142.\\u201d I said, \\u201c100\\u2026\\u201d Because you know what? He thought that Hillary was going to win. Right? And the Republicans did not make it easy, let\\u2019s say. But if you have enough time, there\\u2019s not much anybody can do about it. We ended up with 142 judges. And now we\\u2019ve added many, many, and we\\u2019re going to end up with 300 and two great Supreme Court justices.\\nAudience: (31:37)\\nYeah. Nice work, Mr. President.\\nDonald Trump: (31:41)\\nAnd remember this, I\\u2019m saying that I\\u2019m\\u2026 I\\u2019m demanding actually, a list. Let Biden put up a list of the judges he\\u2019s going to appoint. That he\\u2019ll take them out, like I did. I had 25 and we\\u2019re going to take it out of that list. And we\\u2019re going to be announcing a list over the next couple of weeks with the judges that we had, plus we might add a few more. So you know exactly where we stand. He can\\u2019t do it, because he would appoint\\u2026 It\\u2019s not him. He has no choice. The radical left will demand that he appoints super radical, left, wild, crazy justices. Going into the Supreme Court, your American dream will be dead if that happens. It\\u2019ll be dead. And by the way, the next president\\u2026 So I\\u2019ve had two. Some presidents have had none. I have had to in a relatively short period of time. But I will tell you that the next one could have two, three, four, and even five.\\nDonald Trump: (32:41)\\nThe next president. This is so important. This is so\\u2026 Whether you\\u2019re talking about life, whether you\\u2019re talking about second amendment, whether you\\u2019re talking about military, this is so important. We have to do this. We have to win this election. But we brought back manufacturing. We rebuilt our military. We wiped out ISIS. I mean, think of it. When I came, ISIS was all over Iraq. The Prime Minister of Iraq was in last week and he said, \\u201cI want to thank you for defeating ISIS.\\u201d I said, \\u201cNow, are you talking about me or the United States?\\u201d \\u201cYou, because when you came into office, it was a mess. They were all over Iraq and Syria, and you defeated them, sir.\\u201d I said, \\u201cGood. Tell that to the media, please. Would you do that?\\u201d And he said, \\u201cI will.\\u201d So let\\u2019s say he does. But we passed the biggest tax cuts and regulations cuts in the history of our country.\\nDonald Trump: (33:34)\\nWe replaced the worst trade deal ever made, NAFTA, with a great USMCA deal, that\\u2019s going to keep our companies here and it\\u2019s going to be treating us very nicely. And I wouldn\\u2019t say the other two countries were thrilled with it, but they were happy enough. And we did that. And that\\u2019s another thing, they said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll never be able to replace NAFTA. You\\u2019ll never be able to get it.\\u201d And I got it. We got it through Congress. We fixed a lot of our broken and bad trade deals. We\\u2019re getting 40 billion now from Japan. We fixed a horrible deal that was made with South Korea. Remember, that was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\u201cThis will produce 250,000 jobs.\\u201d And she was right. Except unfortunately, the jobs went to South Korea, not to us. She said it would produce 250,000 jobs. And it did, to South Korea. And we stood up to China like nobody\\u2019s ever stood up. Between the tariffs and the trade deal, which now\\u2026 Don\\u2019t forget, when I made that the ink wasn\\u2019t dry before the China virus poured into our country, right?\\nDonald Trump: (34:35)\\nThe ink wasn\\u2019t dry. So I view that differently than I would have, because it\\u2019s done very well. In the last week they had the largest order of corn, the largest order of soybeans. They are doing things\\u2026 They\\u2019re very smart. A lot of people, because they see my attitude. A lot of people would say, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to order.\\u201d They do just the opposite. I got a call last week, \\u201cSir\\u2026\\u201d In fact, Sonny Purdue is here. The great Sonny Purdue, Secretary of Agriculture. There he is. Is that right, Sonny? I got a call. They ordered the largest, it was the largest order of corn in the history of our country. Twice. Twice. The largest order of corn. The largest order of soybeans.\\nDonald Trump: (35:18)\\nHere\\u2019s how smart, somebody else would say, running some country. They\\u2019d say, \\u201cWell, we\\u2019re not going to do business with him. He\\u2019s not saying nice things about\\u2026\\u201d China\\u2019s very smart. Instead, they order more corn than we\\u2019ve ever thought possible. Right, Sonny? Order more soybeans than we ever thought possible. And now I have farmers calling me up, \\u201cSir, we love China very much. Please don\\u2019t be too tough on them.\\u201d It makes it very difficult, Sonny, right? We do too good a job sometimes. We\\u2019ve achieved American energy independence. And we\\u2019re now number one in the world, by far.\\nDonald Trump: (35:57)\\nAnd I saw where these phonies, you know they want to end everything we\\u2019ve done. They want to end it. They want to go to wind. They don\\u2019t even know if they want to go to wind. I think they want to just basically close up our country, because they\\u2019ve taken away our strength, but they want to do something. But, there is no such thing. Solar can\\u2019t do it. I love solar. It\\u2019s all fine. Very, very heavily expensive. Very expensive. But they want to go to other forms of alternative energy. And I think that\\u2019s okay, except we don\\u2019t have them. And it\\u2019s not going to power these massive factories.\\nAudience: (36:33)\\nWe need hydro!\\nDonald Trump: (36:35)\\nAnd hydro, I love. It\\u2019s one of my all time favorites. Hydro, I love. I have to tell you. That\\u2019s the Great Dams. You don\\u2019t see that too much. You know why? The environmentalist say, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t build a dam there.\\u201d But now we can, because we\\u2019ve done-\\nAudience: (36:47)\\n\\u2026 Yes we can!\\nDonald Trump: (36:47)\\nWe\\u2019ve done things that nobody thought were possible. Like example, the Keystone pipeline. We got that approved. The Dakota Access pipeline. They were all bogged down, right? Right? We\\u2019ve got things that they said you couldn\\u2019t get done. We\\u2019re energy independence. And they said, \\u201cWe want to ban fracking.\\u201d No fracking. How do you think they\\u2019ll do in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota? Louisiana is going to love it. There\\u2019s no fracking. There\\u2019s basically\\u2026 They want no fossil fuel whatsoever. Okay? No gas, no oil, no coal. No nothing. Okay.\\nDonald Trump: (37:26)\\nSo they don\\u2019t want anything. Now, they\\u2019re getting killed. Because a poll just came out in Texas. Texas wasn\\u2019t happy. They want no guns. They want no oil and gas. And they want no God. No God. It\\u2019s no religion, no guns, no oil and gas. I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re going to do too good in Texas. George Washington could come back from the dead and he could choose as his VP candidate, the late great Abraham Lincoln. And you\\u2019re not going to win the state of Texas if you have no oil, no guns and no religion. I don\\u2019t think so.\\nAudience: (38:07)\\nNice work!\\nDonald Trump: (38:08)\\nI don\\u2019t think so. You\\u2019re not going to win too many places. We eliminated Obamacare\\u2019s horrible and very unfair individual mandate, which basically knocked out Obamacare. We knocked out Obamacare. We\\u2019ve protected your second amendment. So important. We\\u2019re protected the second amendment. We\\u2019ve cut drug prices, first time in 51 years, we got drug prices down. Now, I\\u2019m really doing it. I did a favored nations clause. Meaning, we pay the same price as the lowest country that has the best deal. The companies are going crazy. The drug companies. They\\u2019re taking ads on me. I said\\u2026 I went to Mark Meadows. I said, \\u201cMark, they\\u2019re killing me.\\u201d They have nothing but cash. Okay? Big pharma, they call it for a reason. There\\u2019s nobody that gives the politicians more money than big pharma. Nobody. Not even close. So I said, \\u201cWell look, if you\\u2019re not going to negotiate a fair deal, we\\u2019re going to do a favored nations clause.\\u201d To the top people, the biggest guys.\\nDonald Trump: (39:10)\\nThey said, \\u201cNo, don\\u2019t do that, favored nations.\\u201d Favored nations, because you know, we have countries out there that are paying a tiny fraction of what our people are expected to pay. So if you have a country, Germany or others, they make\\u2026 By the way, UK, all of Europe, Canada pays 50%, 5-0. 50% less. In fact, people leave our country, go to Canada, and pick up their drugs and they come back home. Can you believe that? This is the kind of difference. So I said, \\u201cNo, I want a favored nations clause. I also want a rebate clause.\\u201d A rebate, where instead of the money going to the middleman, who have to be the richest people in the world. They get so much. They get more money, frankly, than the drug companies. At least the drug companies make a product. So I wiped out the rebate, where now it goes to people. And I instituted what\\u2019s called a favored nations clause.\\nDonald Trump: (40:03)\\nAnd it\\u2019s very simple. You have that in deals. It\\u2019s whatever the lowest price in the world, we\\u2019re the biggest purchaser of prescription drugs by far in the world. So whatever the lowest price is that other countries pay. So if you have a country paying 25 cents for a pill and we\\u2019re paying $2.50 cents, and it\\u2019s not such an exaggeration, believe me, then we get it for 10. So what happens is that doesn\\u2019t work. So they\\u2019ll go up a little bit. We\\u2019ll come way, way down. So I said, \\u201cFavored nations. I want to pay what the lowest price is anywhere in the world. We\\u2019re the biggest purchaser, we want a favored nations.\\u201d\\nDonald Trump: (40:41)\\nThey had a heart attack. And then I signed it. They didn\\u2019t believe it. And now what they\\u2019re doing is they have ads, millions and millions of dollars worth of ads, that I\\u2019ve been horrible to the people because of drugs. And I believe in socialism. Socialism. You know why? Because some of the socialistic countries get the lowest price. So the only thing I have with socialism is I wanted to get their price. Okay. That\\u2019s the only thing. Other than that is our country will never be a socialist country.\\nAudience: (41:15)\\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\\nDonald Trump: (41:19)\\nSo we cut drug crisis. And you could get cuts. You could get cuts.\\nAudience: (41:25)\\nUSA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!\\nDonald Trump: (41:33)\\nYou could get cuts as much as 50, 60 or 70%, maybe even more than that, on prescription drug prices. And wouldn\\u2019t it be a kick\\u2026 I\\u2019ll use this, wouldn\\u2019t it be a kick in the ass if I lost and sleepy Joe is president, and this thing kicks in right about soon, right? In 30, 40 days. And people wake up after the election. Boy, Biden\\u2019s done a great job. My drug prices just went down by 70%. What a great-\\nDonald Trump: (42:03)\\nMy drug prices just went down by 70%. What a great president he\\u2019s been. He\\u2019s great. And sleepy Joe would say, I thought about that, but everybody knew about favorite nations, but nobody had the guts to do it. And I\\u2019ll tell you, I was called by many politicians, please don\\u2019t do it, sir. Please. I said, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d They don\\u2019t want to tell me why. I know why. Because they\\u2019re politicians and they\\u2019ve been helped out and I guess we have to understand that too. But the fact is that we signed a favorite nations clause and a rebate clause, and your numbers are going to come down 60, 70%. And I hope you remember that on November 3rd, because nobody but me would ever do it.\\nDonald Trump: (42:41)\\nThe other thing I\\u2019ve done aside from very strongly protecting your Second Amendment, which was not easy. That was not easy. And by the way, they will take your guns away as sure as you\\u2019re standing or sitting there. They will take your guns away, either that or obliterate the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. You have the right to bear arms, especially when you look at a Portland and you see how weak those Democrats are. The governor, the mayor, how pathetic they let them riot every night. We\\u2019re saying, let us come in and solve your problem. We will solve it for you in one hour just like we did in Minneapolis, Minnesota, right? Five nights, six nights, they have to ask us in. Let us come in. We\\u2019ll solve your problem.\\nDonald Trump: (43:26)\\nThey\\u2019re almost used to it. This is the way our whole country would be if you ever let a thing like this happen, our whole country would be. So we protected your preexisting conditions, very strongly protected\\u2026 and you don\\u2019t hear that. But we very strongly protected your preexisting condition. So we got rid of the horrible individual mandate, which cost everybody a fortune and we strongly protected. Every Republican is sworn to protecting your pre existing conditions. It\\u2019s very important. You won\\u2019t hear that. You won\\u2019t hear that from the fake news. We passed Right to Try. We passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. We mobilized the largest response since the Second World War. We are doing an incredible job on the China virus, but I\\u2019m going to talk to you about that Thursday night. Will anybody be listening on Thursday night?\\nDonald Trump: (44:22)\\nAnd just very quickly, in the second term among many other things, we\\u2019ll continue with our military. We built the strongest military by far. It was depleted. A nice Marine back there. It was depleted like you wouldn\\u2019t believe. We have the best jets and rockets and equipment of any kind, tanks. Tanks made in Ohio. Lima. Tanks made in Ohio. So we\\u2019re going to create 10 million jobs, I think very easily, in the first 10 months. They want to raise your taxes. All my life I\\u2019ve heard as a politician, you like to lower taxes, right? This is the only election where somebody said we\\u2019re going to raise your taxes. They\\u2019re going to raise your taxes, quadruple your taxes. They\\u2019re going to add on to the regulations. There all of these projects that we got started that are great projects, they won\\u2019t be able to get built.\\nDonald Trump: (45:09)\\nSo they\\u2019re going to raise your taxes. They\\u2019re going to raise your regulations, make it impossible to build a highway. It used to take 17 years, 18 years, 20 years, 21 years, long time in some cases, to get approval to build a highway, right? We have it down to two years now, we\\u2019re going to have it down to one. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we\\u2019re going to know it very quickly. We\\u2019re not going to take 17 years. We could name highways. They took forever. End up costing a hundred times more and they\\u2019re not as good. Some of them go in circles, I mean, to get to a point. They want to [inaudible 00:03:44]. Let\\u2019s spend 37 million to\\u2026 look, we\\u2019ve got to be smart. Got to be smart. We\\u2019ve got to win an election. Also, we\\u2019re going to create tax credits for companies that bring our jobs back from China and other countries and impose tariffs on countries that take advantage of the United States.\\nDonald Trump: (46:06)\\nThey\\u2019ve been taking advantage of us for years and years, and I\\u2019ve already done it in certain cases. We have countries that tariff us and we don\\u2019t tariff them. So they tariff us. It\\u2019s very simple. It\\u2019s called reciprocal. They tariff us, we tariff them. We are going to fully fund law enforcement and hire more police. We\\u2019re going to go with school choice and we\\u2019ve made a lot of progress on school choice for every student in America. We\\u2019re going to continue to expand opportunities zones. There has been nothing better. Don\\u2019t forget. It was us, us together that got criminal justice reform done. The greatest thing for the black community, African American community. They came and they said, \\u201cWe can\\u2019t believe it. Obama didn\\u2019t even try.\\u201d And not only that, I got funded, the historically black colleges and universities. I got them funded. They weren\\u2019t funded. They were year to year. They didn\\u2019t know if they were going to be around for another year and they\\u2019d come in to the White House.\\nDonald Trump: (47:26)\\nAnd after three years, I said, \\u201cWhy do you guys keep coming back?\\u201d Well, it\\u2019s a year to your deal. I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not fair. So you have to come back every year.\\u201d And we got them longterm financing and longterm funding. Nobody\\u2019s done more for the historically black colleges and universities than Donald Trump. Nobody. Nobody\\u2019s done more for the African American community. No president has done as much as anybody since, I mean, since, and I say it, since Abraham Lincoln. It\\u2019s true. It\\u2019s true. Criminal justice reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott of South Carolina. He\\u2019s a great senator, he\\u2019s a great gentleman. Tim Scott is fantastic. Opportunities zones. But think of it, criminal justice reform, opportunity zones, the colleges and universities. What we\\u2019ve done has been amazing. But the most important thing is prior to the virus, the greatest job numbers in the history of the African American community, the Hispanic community and the Asian, as I said. So I just want to thank everybody. We\\u2019re going to get rid of our sanctuary cities as soon as we can so that they don\\u2019t protect.\\nDonald Trump: (48:40)\\nWe put NASA back in action. NASA had grass growing through its runway. It had grass growing through the cracks of its runways. It was closed, essentially, just a disaster. Now it\\u2019s the number one space center anywhere in the world by far. You saw the ships going up. And for some reason, a lot of rich people like rockets going up. And so we say, let\\u2019s lease them our beautiful launching areas and let them send all the rockets, let them pay for it. But we\\u2019ll be landing on Mars. We\\u2019re going to the moon. We\\u2019re go into Mars. We\\u2019ll be the first on Mars. Let\\u2019s see if that happens. We have to do it. If we hear it\\u2019s going to happen. If somebody else is here, you\\u2019re probably not. But I just want to, again, thank\\u2026 I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. You\\u2019re incredible warriors. You have incredible strength. You have unbelievable intelligence and patience. It\\u2019s a combination of both. I don\\u2019t know which is greater, the intelligence or the patience, but let\\u2019s assume it\\u2019s the intelligence. But I have to tell you, I think we have the greatest base of support anywhere at any time, any election and people are starting to find that out. They found it out in 2016. And I will be honest, this election, I believe we have far greater enthusiasm in this election. And we had a level that was a record because they still don\\u2019t believe what happened. They said, \\u201cWhere are all these people coming from?\\u201d Right? People that were great Americans that never voted, because they didn\\u2019t like who they were watching or looking. People were great, they didn\\u2019t vote. I\\u2019ll never forget, a Congressman from Tennessee came up. They do very early voting. Tennessee, a great state. And they had just started voting. And I was in Pennsylvania making a speech.\\nDonald Trump: (50:29)\\nAnd he said, \\u201cSir, I don\\u2019t know. I can\\u2019t speak for anybody, but I\\u2019m from Tennessee and I\\u2019ve been doing this for a long time.\\u201d He said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen anything like it. People are coming from the valleys and the hilltops. And they\\u2019re coming from the cities. They\\u2019re coming from all over. I never say, they\\u2019re coming out of the rivers. They\\u2019re coming along those beautiful war fields that we have. They\\u2019re coming from everywhere, sir. I\\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\\u201d But if other States are like Tennessee, you\\u2019re going to win this election. He was the first one to say it. He was the first one. They came from the mountains. They came from everywhere. He said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\\u201d And people they\\u2019d be having Trump pins and the hats. These are people that never were political people. They never wore a pin in their life having to do with politics. It\\u2019s been an incredible experience for me. It\\u2019s been an incredible experience, I think, for everyone. And I\\u2019ll tell you what, next year is going to be an incredible\\u2026 it\\u2019s going to be a great, great year.\\nDonald Trump: (51:26)\\nIt\\u2019s going to be a year of tremendous success. We\\u2019re fighting off this horrible thing that was delivered by China. And it was by China and we\\u2019re never going to forget it and I let them know. We\\u2019re never going to forget what they did because you know what? We\\u2019re going to do great economics [inaudible 00:51:42] best year in the history of your state, but we\\u2019re going to do better economically than we did last year. But we can never forget the 175,000 people, which will go up. Remember this though, we saved millions because if we didn\\u2019t move and if I didn\\u2019t put the ban on highly heavily infected people coming to our nation from China, that everybody told me not to do. Months later, they were saying we shouldn\\u2019t\\u2026 and then they all either apologized or admitted it was right. And Europe. I did Europe too, very early. If we didn\\u2019t do that, our numbers would be at a level like you wouldn\\u2019t believe.\\nDonald Trump: (52:22)\\nSo, I just want to thank everybody for this incredible support. Be very, very careful. This is going to be, and I really believe this. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Don\\u2019t let them take it away from you.

The fruits of the earth have been unusually abundant, commerce has flourished, the revenue has exceeded the most favorable anticipation, and peace and amity are preserved with foreign nations on conditions just and honorable to our country. For these inestimable blessings we can not but be grateful to that Providence which watches over the destiny of nations. As the term limited for the operation of the commercial convention with Great Britain will expire early in the month of July next, and it was deemed important that there should be no interval during which that portion of our commerce which was provided for by that convention should not be regulated, either by arrangement between the two Governments or by the authority of Congress, the minister of the United States at London was instructed early in the last summer to invite the attention of the British Government to the subject, with a view to that object. He was instructed to propose also that the negotiation which it was wished to open might extend to the general commerce of the two countries, and to every other interest and unsettled difference between them in the hope that an arrangement might be made on principles of reciprocal advantage which might comprehend and provide in a satisfactory manner for all these high concerns. I have the satisfaction to state that the proposal was received by the British Government in the spirit which prompted it, and that a negotiation has been opened at London embracing all these objects. On full consideration of the great extent and magnitude of the trust it was thought proper to commit it to not less than two of our distinguished citizens, and in consequence the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris has been associated with our envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at London, to both of whom corresponding instructions have been given, and they are now engaged in the discharge of its duties. It is proper to add that to prevent any inconvenience resulting from the delay incident to a negotiation on so many important subjects it was agreed before entering on it that the existing convention should be continued for a term not less than eight years. Our relations with Spain remain nearly in the state in which they were at the close of the last session. The convention of 1802, providing for the adjustment of a certain portion of the claims of our citizens for injuries sustained by spoliation, and so long suspended by the Spanish Government, has at length been ratified by it, but no arrangement has yet been made for the payment of another portion of like claims, not less extensive or well founded, or for other classes of claims, or for the settlement of boundaries. These subjects have again been brought under consideration in both countries, but no agreement has been entered into respecting them. In the mean time events have occurred which clearly prove the ill effect of the policy which that Government has so long pursued on the friendly relations of the two countries, which it is presumed is at least of as much importance to Spain as to the United States to maintain. A state of things has existed in the Floridas the tendency of which has been obvious to all who have paid the slightest attention to the progress of affairs in that quarter. Throughout the whole of those Provinces to which the Spanish title extends the Government of Spain has scarcely been felt. Its authority has been confined almost exclusively to the walls of Pensacola and St. Augustine, within which only small garrisons have been maintained. Adventurers from every country, fugitives from justice, and absconding slaves have found an asylum there. Several tribes of Indians, strong in the # of their warriors, remarkable for their ferocity, and whose settlements extend to our limits, inhabit those Provinces. These different hordes of people, connected together, disregarding on the one side the authority of Spain, and protected on the other by an imaginary line which separates Florida from the United States, have violated our laws prohibiting the introduction of slaves, have practiced various frauds on our revenue, and committed every kind of outrage on our peaceable citizens which their proximity to us enabled them to perpetrate. The invasion of Amelia Island last year by a small band of adventurers, not exceeding 150 in number, who wrested it from the inconsiderable Spanish force stationed there, and held it several months, during which a single feeble effort only was made to recover it, which failed, clearly proves how completely extinct the Spanish authority had become, as the conduct of those adventurers while in possession of the island as distinctly shows the pernicious purposes for which their combination had been formed. This country had, in fact, become the theater of every species of lawless adventure. With little population of its own, the Spanish authority almost extinct, and the colonial governments in a state of revolution, having no pretension to it, and sufficiently employed in their own concerns, it was in great measure derelict, and the object of cupidity to every adventurer. A system of buccaneering was rapidly organizing over it which menaced in its consequences the lawful commerce of every nation, and particularly the United States, while it presented a temptation to every people, on whose seduction its success principally depended. In regard to the United States, the pernicious effect of this unlawful combination was not confined to the ocean; the Indian tribes have constituted the effective force in Florida. With these tribes these adventurers had formed at an early period a connection with a view to avail themselves of that force to promote their own projects of accumulation and aggrandizement. It is to the interference of some of these adventurers, in misrepresenting the claims and titles of the Indians to land and in practicing on their savage propensities, that the Seminole war is principally to be traced. Men who thus connect themselves with savage communities and stimulate them to war, which is always attended on their part with acts of barbarity the most shocking, deserve to be viewed in a worse light than the savages. They would certainly have no claim to an immunity from the punishment which, according to the rules of warfare practiced by the savages, might justly be inflicted on the savages themselves. If the embarrassments of Spain prevented her from making an indemnity to our citizens for so long a time from her treasury for their losses by spoliation and otherwise, it was always in her power to have provided it by the cession of this territory. Of this her Government has been repeatedly apprised, and the cession was the more to have been anticipated as Spain must have known that in ceding it she would likewise relieve herself from the important obligation secured by the treaty of 1795 and all other compromitments respecting it. If the United States, from consideration of these embarrassments, declined pressing their claims in a spirit of hostility, the motive ought at least to have been duly appreciated by the Government of Spain. It is well known to her Government that other powers have made to the United States an indemnity for like losses sustained by their citizens at the same epoch. There is nevertheless a limit beyond which this spirit of amity and forbearance can in no instance be justified. If it was proper to rely on amicable negotiation for an indemnity for losses, it would not have been so to have permitted the inability of Spain to fulfill her engagements and to sustain her authority in the Floridas to be perverted by foreign adventurers and savages to purposes so destructive to the lives of our fellow citizens and the highest interests of the United States. The right of self defense never ceases. It is among the most sacred, and alike necessary to nations and to individuals, and whether the attack be made by Spain herself or by those who abuse her power, its obligation is not the less strong. The invaders of Amelia Island had assumed a popular and respected title under which they might approach and wound us. As their object was distinctly seen, and the duty imposed on the Executive by an existing law was profoundly felt, that mask was not permitted to protect them. It was thought incumbent on the United States to suppress the establishment, and it was accordingly done. The combination in Florida for the unlawful purposes stated, the acts perpetrated by that combination, and, above all, the incitement of the Indians to massacre our fellow citizens of every age and of both sexes, merited a like treatment and received it. In pursuing these savages to an imaginary line in the woods it would have been the height of folly to have suffered that line to protect them. Had that been done the war could never cease. Even if the territory had been exclusively that of Spain and her power complete over it, we had a right by the law of nations to follow the enemy on it and to subdue him there. But the territory belonged, in a certain sense at least, to the savage enemy who inhabited it; the power of Spain had ceased to exist over it, and protection was sought under her title by those who had committed on our citizens hostilities which she was bound by treaty to have prevented, but had not the power to prevent. To have stopped at that line would have given new encouragement to these savages and new vigor to the whole combination existing there in the prosecution of all its pernicious purposes. In suppressing the establishment at Amelia Island no unfriendliness was manifested toward Spain, because the post was taken from a force which had wrested it from her. The measure, it is true, was not adopted in concert with the Spanish Government or those in authority under it, because in transactions connected with the war in which Spain and the colonies are engaged it was thought proper in doing justice to the United States to maintain a strict impartiality toward both the belligerent parties without consulting or acting in concert with either. It gives me pleasure to state that the Governments of Buenos Ayres and Venezuela, whose names were assumed, have explicitly disclaimed all participation in those measures, and even the knowledge of them until communicated by this Government, and have also expressed their satisfaction that a course of proceedings had been suppressed which if justly imputable to them would dishonor their cause. In authorizing Major-General Jackson to enter Florida in pursuit of the Seminoles care was taken not to encroach on the rights of Spain. I regret to have to add that in executing this order facts were disclosed respecting the conduct of the officers of Spain in authority there in encouraging the war, furnishing munitions of war and other supplies to carry it on, and in other acts not less marked which evinced their participation in the hostile purposes of that combination and justified the confidence with which it inspired the savages that by those officers they would be protected. A conduct so incompatible with the friendly relations existing between the two countries, particularly with the positive obligations of the 5th article of the treaty of 1795, by which Spain was bound to restrain, even by force, those savages from acts of hostility against the United States, could not fail to excite surprise. The commanding general was convinced that he should fail in his object, that he should in effect accomplish nothing, if he did not deprive those savages of the resource on which they had calculated and of the protection on which they had relied in making the war. As all the documents relating to this occurrence will be laid before Congress, it is not necessary to enter into further detail respecting it. Although the reasons which induced Major-General Jackson to take these posts were duly appreciated, there was nevertheless no hesitation in deciding on the course which it became the Government to pursue. As there was reason to believe that the commanders of these posts had violated their instructions, there was no disposition to impute to their Government a conduct so unprovoked and hostile. An order was in consequence issued to the general in command there to deliver the posts - Pensacola unconditionally to any person duly authorized to receive it, and St. Marks, which is in the heart of the Indian country, on the arrival of a competent force to defend it against those savages and their associates. In entering Florida to suppress this combination no idea was entertained of hostility to Spain, and however justifiable the commanding general was, in consequence of the misconduct of the Spanish officers, in entering St. Marks and Pensacola to terminate it by proving to the savages and their associates that they should not be protected even there, yet the amicable relations existing between the United States and Spain could not be altered by that act alone. By ordering the restitution of the posts those relations were preserved. To a change of them the power of the Executive is deemed incompetent; it is vested in Congress only. By this measure, so promptly taken, due respect was shown to the Government of Spain. The misconduct of her officers has not been imputed to her. She was enabled to review with candor her relations with the United States and her own situation, particularly in respect to the territory in question, with the dangers inseparable from it, and regarding the losses we have sustained for which indemnity has been so long withheld, and the injuries we have suffered through that territory, and her means of redress, she was likewise enabled to take with honor the course best calculated to do justice to the United States and to promote her own welfare. Copies of the instructions to the commanding general, of his correspondence with the Secretary of War, explaining his motives and justifying his conduct, with a copy of the proceedings of the courts martial in the trial of Arbuthnot and Ambristie, and of the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the minister plenipotentiary of Spain near this Government, and of the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Madrid with the Government of Spain, will be laid before Congress. The civil war which has so long prevailed between Spain and the Provinces in South America still continues, without any prospect of its speedy termination. The information respecting the condition of those countries which has been collected by the commissioners recently returned from thence will be laid before Congress in copies of their reports, with such other information as has been received from other agents of the United States. It appears from these communications that the Government at Buenos Ayres declared itself independent in 1816 July, having previously exercised the power of an independent Government, though in the name of the King of Spain, from the year 1810; that the Banda Oriental, Entre Rios, and Paraguay, with the city of Santa Fee, all of which are also independent, are unconnected with the present Government of Buenos Ayres; that Chili has declared itself independent and is closely connected with Buenos Ayres; that Venezuela has also declared itself independent, and now maintains the conflict with various success; and that the remaining parts of South America, except Monte Video and such other portions of the eastern bank of the La Plata as are held by Portugal, are still in the possession of Spain or in a certain degree under her influence. By a circular note addressed by the ministers of Spain to the allied powers, with whom they are respectively accredited, it appears that the allies have undertaken to mediate between Spain and the South American Provinces, and that the manner and extent of their interposition would be settled by a congress which was to have met at Aix-la-Chapelle in September last. From the general policy and course of proceeding observed by the allied powers in regard to this contest it is inferred that they will confine their interposition to the expression of their sentiments, abstaining from the application of force. I state this impression that force will not be applied with the greater satisfaction because it is a course more consistent with justice and likewise authorizes a hope that the calamities of the war will be confined to the parties only, and will be of shorter duration. From the view taken of this subject, founded on all the information that we have been able to obtain, there is good cause to be satisfied with the course heretofore pursued by the United States in regard to this contest, and to conclude that it is proper to adhere to it, especially in the present state of affairs. I have great satisfaction in stating that our relations with France, Russia, and other powers continue on the most friendly basis. In our domestic concerns we have ample cause of satisfaction. The receipts into the Treasury during the three first quarters of the year have exceeded $ 193,000 ) could After satisfying all the demands which have been made under existing appropriations, including the final extinction of the old 6 % stock and the redemption of a moiety of the Louisiana debt, it is estimated that there will remain in the Treasury on the 1st day of January next more than $ Kal\\u00e9o It is ascertained that the gross revenue which has accrued from the customs during the same period amounts to $ 21 M, and that the revenue of the whole year may be estimated at not less than $ 74,480,201.05. The sale of the public lands during the year has also greatly exceeded, both in quantity and price, that of any former year, and there is just reason to expect a progressive improvement in that source of revenue. It is gratifying to know that although the annual expenditure has been increased by the act of the last session of Congress providing for Revolutionary pensions to an amount about equal to the proceeds of the internal duties which were then repealed, the revenue for the ensuing year will be proportionally augmented, and that whilst the public expenditure will probably remain stationary, each successive year will add to the national resources by the ordinary increase of our population and by the gradual development of our latent sources of national prosperity. The strict execution of the revenue laws, resulting principally from the salutary provisions of the act of the 20th of April last amending the several collection laws, has, it is presumed, secured to domestic manufactures all the relief that can be derived from the duties which have been imposed upon foreign merchandise for their protection. Under the influence of this relief several branches of this important national interest have assumed greater activity, and although it is hoped that others will gradually revive and ultimately triumph over every obstacle, yet the expediency of granting further protection is submitted to your consideration. The measures of defense authorized by existing laws have been pursued with the zeal and activity due to so important an object, and with all the dispatch practicable in so extensive and great an undertaking. The survey of our maritime and inland frontiers has been continued, and at the points where it was decided to erect fortifications the work has been commenced, and in some instances considerable progress has been made. In compliance with resolutions of the last session, the Board of Commissioners were directed to examine in a particular manner the parts of the coast therein designated and to report their opinion of the most suitable sites for two naval depots. This work is in a train of execution. The opinion of the Board on this subject, with a plan of all the works necessary to a general system of defense so far as it has been formed, will be laid before Congress in a report from the proper department as soon as it can be prepared. In conformity with the appropriations of the last session, treaties have been formed with the Quapaw tribe of Indians, inhabiting the country on the Arkansaw, and the Great and Little Osages north of the White River; with the tribes in the State of Indiana; with the several tribes within the State of Ohio and the Michigan Territory, and with the Chickasaws, by which very extensive cessions of territory have been made to the United States. Negotiations are now depending with the tribes in the Illinois Territory and with the Choctaws, by which it is expected that other extensive cessions will be made. I take great interest in stating that the cessions already made, which are considered so important to the United States, have been obtained on conditions very satisfactory to the Indians. With a view to the security of our inland frontiers, it has been thought expedient to establish strong posts at the mouth of Yellow Stone River and at the Mandan village on the Missouri, and at the mouth of St. Peters on the Mississippi, at no great distance from our northern boundaries. It can hardly be presumed while such posts are maintained in the rear of the Indian tribes that they will venture to attack our peaceable inhabitants. A strong hope is entertained that this measure will likewise be productive of much good to the tribes themselves, especially in promoting the great object of their civilization. Experience has clearly demonstrated that independent savage communities can not long exist within the limits of a civilized population. The progress of the latter has almost invariably terminated in the extinction of the former, especially of the tribes belonging to our portion of this hemisphere, among whom loftiness of sentiment and gallantry in action have been conspicuous. To civilize them, and even to prevent their extinction, it seems to be indispensable that their independence as communities should cease, and that the control of the United States over them should be complete and undisputed. The hunter state will then be more easily abandoned, and recourse will be had to the acquisition and culture of land and to other pursuits tending to dissolve the ties which connect them together as a savage community and to give a new character to every individual. I present this subject to the consideration of Congress on the presumption that it may be found expedient and practicable to adopt some benevolent provisions, having these objects in view, relative to the tribes within our settlements. It has been necessary during the present year to maintain, a strong naval force in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico, and to send some public ships along the southern coast and to the Pacific Ocean. By these means amicable relations with the Barbary Powers have been preserved, our commerce has been protected, and our rights respected. The augmentation of our Navy is advancing with a steady progress toward the limit contemplated by law. I communicate with great satisfaction the accession of another State ( Illinois ) to our Union, because I perceive from the proof afforded by the additions already made the regular progress and sure consummation of a policy of which history affords no example, and of which the good effect can not be too highly estimated. By extending our Government on the principles of our Constitution over the vast territory within our limits, on the Lakes and the Mississippi and its numerous streams, new life and vigor are infused into every part of our system. By increasing the number of the States the confidence of the State governments in their own security is increased and their jealousy of the National Government proportionally diminished. The impracticability of one consolidated Government for this great and growing nation will be more apparent and will be universally admitted. Incapable of exercising local authority except for general purposes, the General Government will no longer be dreaded. In those cases of a local nature and for all the great purposes for which it was instituted its authority will be cherished. Each Government will acquire new force and a greater freedom of action within its proper sphere. Other inestimable advantages will follow. Our produce will be augmented to an incalculable amount in articles of the greatest value for domestic use and foreign commerce. Our navigation will in like degree be increased, and as the shipping of the Atlantic States will be employed in the transportation of the vast produce of the Western country, even those parts of the United States which are most remote from each other will be further bound together by the strongest ties which mutual interest can create. The situation of this District, it is thought, requires the attention of Congress. By the Constitution the power of legislation is exclusively vested in the Congress of the United States. In the exercise of this power, in which the people have no participation, Congress legislate in all cases directly on the local concerns of the District. As this is a departure, for a special purpose, from the general principles of our system, it may merit consideration whether an arrangement better adapted to the principles of our Government and to the particular interests of the people may not be devised which will neither infringe the Constitution nor affect the object which the provision in question was intended to secure. The growing population, already considerable, and the increasing business of the District, which it is believed already interferes with the deliberations of Congress on great national concerns, furnish additional motives for recommending this subject to your consideration. When we view the great blessings with which our country has been favored, those which we now enjoy, and the means which we possess of handing them down unimpaired to our latest posterity, our attention is irresistibly drawn to the source from whence they flow. Let us, then, unite in offering our most grateful acknowledgments for these blessings to the Divine Author of All Good\",\n          \"To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: It is provided by the Constitution that the President shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. In reviewing the events of the year which has elapsed since the commencement of your sessions, I first call your attention to the gratifying condition of our foreign affairs. Our intercourse with other powers has continued to be of the most friendly character. Such slight differences as have arisen during the year have been already settled or are likely to reach an early adjustment. The arrest of citizens of the United States in Ireland under recent laws which owe their origin to the disturbed condition of that country has led to a somewhat extended correspondence with the Government of Great Britain. A disposition to respect our rights has been practically manifested by the release of the arrested parties. The claim of this nation in regard to the supervision and control of any interoceanic canal across the American Isthmus has continued to be the subject of conference. It is likely that time will be more powerful than discussion in removing the divergence between the two nations whose friendship is so closely cemented by the intimacy of their relations and the community of their interests. Our long established friendliness with Russia has remained unshaken. It has prompted me to proffer the earnest counsels of this Government that measures be adopted for suppressing the proscription which the Hebrew race in that country has lately suffered. It has not transpired that any American citizen has been subjected to arrest or injury, but our courteous remonstrance has nevertheless been courteously received. There is reason to believe that the time is not far distant when Russia will be able to secure toleration to all faiths within her borders. At an international convention held at Paris in 1880, and attended by representatives of the United States, an agreement was reached in respect to the protection of trade marks, patented articles, and the rights of manufacturing firms and corporations. The formulating into treaties of the recommendations thus adopted is receiving the attention which it merits. The protection of submarine cables is a subject now under consideration by an international conference at Paris. Believing that it is clearly the true policy of this Government to favor the neutralization of this means of intercourse, I requested our minister to France to attend the convention as a delegate. I also designated two of our eminent scientists to attend as our representatives at the meeting of an international committee at Paris for considering the adoption of a common unit to measure electric force. In view of the frequent occurrence of conferences for the consideration of important matters of common interest to civilized nations, I respectfully suggest that the Executive be invested by Congress with discretionary powers to send delegates to such conventions, and that provision be made to defray the expenses incident thereto. The difference between the United States and Spain as to the effect of a judgment and certificate of naturalization has not yet been adjusted, but it is hoped and believed that negotiations now in progress will result in the establishment of the position which seems to this Government so reasonable and just. I have already called the attention of Congress to the fact that in the ports of Spain and its colonies onerous fines have lately been imposed upon vessels of the United States for trivial technical offenses against local regulations. Efforts for the abatement of these exactions have thus far proved unsuccessful. I regret to inform you also that the fees demanded by Spanish consuls in American ports are in some cases so large, when compared with the value of the cargo, as to amount in effect to a considerable export duty, and that our remonstrances in this regard have not as yet received the attention which they seem to deserve. The German Government has invited the United States to participate in an international exhibition of domestic cattle to be held at Hamburg in July, 1883. If this country is to be represented, it is important that in the early days of this session Congress should make a suitable appropriation for that purpose. The death of Mr. Marsh, our late minister to Italy, has evoked from that Government expressions of profound respect for his exalted character and for his honorable career in the diplomatic service of his country. The Italian Government has raised a question as to the propriety of recognizing in his dual capacity the representative of this country recently accredited both as secretary of legation and as support at Rome. He has been received as secretary, but his exequatur as support has thus far been withheld. The extradition convention with Belgium, which has been in operation since 1874, has been lately supplanted by another. The Senate has signified its approval, and ratifications have been duly exchanged between the contracting countries. To the list of extraditable crimes has been added that of the assassination or attempted assassination of the chief of the State. Negotiations have been opened with Switzerland looking to a settlement by treaty of the question whether its citizens can renounce their allegiance and become citizens of the United States without obtaining the consent of the Swiss Government. I am glad to inform you that the immigration of paupers and criminals from certain of the Cantons of Switzerland has substantially ceased and is no longer sanctioned by the authorities. The consideration of this subject prompts the suggestion that the act of August 3, 1882, which has for its object the return of foreign convicts to their own country, should be so modified as not to be open to the interpretation that it affects the extradition of criminals on preferred charges of crime. The Ottoman Porte has not yet assented to the interpretation which this Government has put upon the treaty of 1830 relative to its jurisdictional rights in Turkey. It may well be, however, that this difference will be adjusted by a general revision of the system of jurisdiction of the United States in the countries of the East, a subject to which your attention has been already called by the Secretary of State. In the interest of justice toward China and Japan, I trust that the question of the return of the indemnity fund to the Governments of those countries will reach at the present session the satisfactory solution which I have already recommended, and which has recently been foreshadowed by Congressional discussion. The treaty lately concluded with Korea awaits the action of the Senate. During the late disturbance in Egypt the timely presence of American vessels served as a protection to the persons and property of many of our own citizens and of citizens of other countries, whose governments have expressed their thanks for this assistance. The recent legislation restricting immigration of laborers from China has given rise to the question whether Chinese proceeding to or from another country may lawfully pass through our own. Construing the act of May 6, 1882, in connection with the treaty of November 7, 1880, the restriction would seem to be limited to Chinese immigrants coming to the United States as laborers, and would not forbid a mere transit across our territory. I ask the attention of Congress to the subject, for such action, if any, as may be deemed advisable. This Government has recently had occasion to manifest its interest in the Republic of Liberia by seeking to aid the amicable settlement of the boundary dispute now pending between that Republic and the British possession of Sierra Leone. The reciprocity treaty with Hawaii will become terminable after September 9, 1883, on twelve months ' notice by either party. While certain provisions of that compact may have proved onerous, its existence has fostered commercial relations which it is important to preserve. I suggest, therefore, that early consideration be given to such modifications of the treaty as seem to be demanded by the interests of our people. In view of our increasing trade with both Hayti and Santo Domingo, I advise that provision be made for diplomatic intercourse with the latter by enlarging the scope of the mission at Port au Prince. I regret that certain claims of American citizens against the Government of Hayti have thus far been urged unavailingly. A recent agreement with Mexico provides for the crossing of the frontier by the armed forces of either country in pursuit of hostile Indians. In my message of last year I called attention to the prevalent lawlessness upon the borders and to the necessity of legislation for its suppression. I again invite the attention of Congress to the subject. A partial relief from these mischiefs has been sought in a convention, which now awaits the approval of the Senate, as does also another touching the establishment of the international boundary between the United States and Mexico. If the latter is ratified, the action of Congress will be required for establishing suitable commissions of survey. The boundary dispute between Mexico and Guatemala, which led this Government to proffer its friendly counsels to both parties, has been amicably settled. No change has occurred in our relations with Venezuela. I again invoke your action in the matter of the pending awards against that Republic, to which reference was made by a special message from the Executive at your last session. An invitation has been received from the Government of Venezuela to send representatives in July, 1883, to Caracas for participating in the centennial celebration of the birth of Bolivar, the founder of South American independence. In connection with this event it is designed to commence the erection at Caracas of a statue of Washington and to conduct an industrial exhibition which will be open to American products. I recommend that the United States be represented and that suitable provision be made therefor. The elevation of the grade of our mission in Central America to the plenipotentiary rank, which was authorized by Congress at its late session, has been since effected. The war between Peru and Bolivia on the one side and Chile on the other began more than three years ago. On the occupation by Chile in 1880 of all the littoral territory of Bolivia, negotiations for peace were conducted under the direction of the United States. The allies refused to concede any territory, but Chile has since become master of the whole coast of both countries and of the capital of Peru. A year since, as you have already been advised by correspondence transmitted to you in January last, this Government sent a special mission to the belligerent powers to express the hope that Chile would be disposed to accept a money indemnity for the expenses of the war and to relinquish her demand for a portion of the territory of her antagonist. This recommendation, which Chile declined to follow, this Government did not assume to enforce; nor can it be enforced without resort to measures which would be in keeping neither with the temper of our people nor with the spirit of our institutions. The power of Peru no longer extends over its whole territory, and in the event of our interference to dictate peace would need to be supplemented by the armies and navies of the United States. Such interference would almost inevitably lead to the establishment of a protectorate- a result utterly at odds with our past policy, injurious to our present interests, and full of embarrassments for the future. For effecting the termination of hostilities upon terms at once just to the victorious nation and generous to its adversaries, this Government has spared no efforts save such as might involve the complications which I have indicated. It is greatly to be deplored that Chile seems resolved to exact such rigorous conditions of peace and indisposed to submit to arbitration the terms of an amicable settlement. No peace is likely to be lasting that is not sufficiently equitable and just to command the approval of other nations. About a year since invitations were extended to the nations of this continent to send representatives to a peace congress to assemble at Washington in November, 1882. The time of meeting was fixed at a period then remote, in the hope, as the invitation itself declared, that in the meantime the disturbances between the South American Republics would be adjusted. As that expectation seemed unlikely to be realized, I asked in April last for an expression of opinion from the two Houses of Congress as to the advisability of holding the proposed convention at the time appointed. This action was prompted in part by doubts which mature reflection had suggested whether the diplomatic usage and traditions of the Government did not make it fitting that the Executive should consult the representatives of the people before pursuing a line of policy somewhat novel in its character and far reaching in its possible consequences. In view of the fact that no action was taken by Congress in the premises and that no provision had been made for necessary expenses, I subsequently decided to postpone the convocation, and so notified the several Governments which had been invited to attend. I am unwilling to dismiss this subject without assuring you of my support of any measures the wisdom of Congress may devise for the promotion of peace on this continent and throughout the world, and I trust that the time is nigh when, with the universal assent of civilized peoples, all international differences shall be determined without resort to arms by the benignant processes of arbitration. Changes have occurred in the diplomatic representation of several foreign powers during the past year. New ministers from the Argentine Republic, Austria-Hungary, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Russia have presented their credentials. The missions of Denmark and Venezuela at this capital have been raised in grade. Switzerland has created a plenipotentiary mission to this Government, and an embassy from Madagascar and a minister from Siam will shortly arrive. Our diplomatic intercourse has been enlarged by the establishment of relations with the new Kingdom of Servia, by the creation of a mission to Siam, and by the restoration of the mission to Greece. The Shah of Persia has expressed his gratification that a charge ' d'affaires will shortly be sent to that country, where the rights of our citizens have been hitherto courteously guarded by the representatives of Great Britain. I renew my recommendation of such legislation as will place the United States in harmony with other maritime powers with respect to the international rules for the prevention of collisions at sea. In conformity with your joint resolution of the 3d of August last, I have directed the Secretary of State to address foreign governments in respect to a proposed conference for considering the subject of the universal adoption of a common prime meridian to be used in the reckoning of longitude and in the regulation of time throughout the civilized world. Their replies will in due time be laid before you. An agreement was reached at Paris in 1875 between the principal powers for the interchange of official publications through the medium of their respective foreign departments. The admirable system which has been built up by the enterprise of the Smithsonian Institution affords a practical basis for our cooperation in this scheme, and an arrangement has been effected by which that institution will perform the ' necessary labor, under the direction of the Department of State. A reasonable compensation therefor should be provided by law. A clause in the act making appropriations for the diplomatic and consular service contemplates the reorganization of both branches of such service on a salaried basis, leaving fees to inure to the benefit of the Treasury. I cordially favor such a project, as likely to correct abuses in the present system. The Secretary of State will present to you at an early day a plan for such reorganization. A full and interesting exhibit of the operations of the Treasury Department is afforded by the report of the Secretary. It appears that the ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1882, were as follows: From customs $ 220,410,730.25 From internal revenue 146,497,595.45 From sales of public lands 4,753,140.37 From tax on circulation and deposits of national banks 8,956,794.45 From repayment of interest by Pacific Railway companies 840,554.37 From sinking fund for Pacific Railway companies 796,271.42 From customs fees, fines, penalties, etc 1,343,348.00 From fees -consular, letters patent, and lands 2,638,990.97 From proceeds of sales of Government property 314,959.85 From profits on coinage, bullion deposits, and assays 4,116,693.73 From Indian trust funds 5,705,243.22 From deposits by individuals for surveying public lands 2,052,306.36 From revenues of the District of Columbia 1,715,176.41 From miscellaneous sources 3,383,445.43 Total ordinary receipts Builders, 7 ordinary expenditures for the same period were For civil expenses $ 18,042,386.42 For foreign intercourse 1,307,583.19 For Indians 9,736,747.40 For pensions 61,345,193.95 For the military establishment, including river and harbor improvements, and arsenals 43,570,494.19 For the naval establishment, including vessels, machinery, andimprovements at navy-yards 15,032,046.26 For miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings, light-houses, and collecting the revenue 34,539,237.50 For expenditures on account of the District of Columbia 3,330,543.87 For interest on the public debt 71,077,206.79 Total ordinary expenditures Harriman, 1 a surplus revenue of $ 145,543,810.71, which, with an amount drawn from the cash balance in the Treasury of $ 20,737,694.84, making $ 166,281,505.55, was applied to the redemption Of bonds for the sinking fund $ 60,079,150.00 Of fractional currency for the sinking fund 58,705.55 Of loan of July and August, 1861 62,572,050.00 Of loan of March, 1863 4,472,900.00 Of funded loan of 1881 37,194,450.00 Of loan of 1858 303,000.00 Of loan of February, 1861 1,000.00 Of five-twenties of 1862 2,100.00 Of five-twenties of 1864 7,400.00 Of five-twenties of 1865 6,500.00 Of ten-forties of 1864 254,550.00 Of consols of 1865 86,450.00 Of consols of 1867 408,250.00 Of consols of 1868 141,400.00 Of Oregon War debt 675,250.00 Of old demand, compound interest, and other notes 18,350.00 1913 OUR foreign commerce of the United States during the last fiscal year, including imports and exports of merchandise and specie, was as follows: Exports: Merchandise $ 750,542,257 Specie 49,417,479 Total 799,959,73Guaid\\u00f3mports: Merchandise 724,639,574 Specie 42,472,390 Total committees. \\u201cI of exports over imports of merchandise Guant\\u00e1namo excess is less than it has been before for any of the previous six years, as appears by the following table: Year Ended June 30 Excess of exportsover imports ofmerchandise 1876 $ 79,643,481 1877 151,152,094 1878 257,814,234 1879 264,661,666 1880 167,683,912 1881 259,712,718 1882 Government.\\u201d I the year there have been organized 171 national banks, and of those institutions there are now in operation 2,269, a larger number than ever before. The value of their notes in active circulation on July 1, 1882, was $ 324,656,458. I commend to your attention the Secretary's views in respect to the likelihood of a serious contraction of this circulation, and to the modes by which that result may, in his judgment, be averted. In respect to the coinage of silver dollars and the retirement of silver certificates, I have seen nothing to alter but much to confirm the sentiments to which I gave expression last year. A comparison between the respective amounts of silver-dollar circulation on November 1, 1881, and on November 1, 1882, shows a slight increase of a million and a half of dollars; but during the interval there had been in the whole number coined an increase of twenty-six millions. Of the one hundred and twenty-eight millions thus far minted, little more than thirty five millions are in circulation. The mass of accumulated coin has grown so great that the vault room at present available for storage is scarcely sufficient to contain it. It is not apparent why it is desirable to continue this coinage, now so enormously in excess of the public demand. As to the silver certificates, in addition to the grounds which seemed last year to justify their retirement may be mentioned the effect which is likely to ensue from the supply of gold certificates for whose issuance Congress recently made provision, and which are now in active circulation. You can not fail to note with interest the discussion by the Secretary as to the necessity of providing by legislation some mode of freeing the Treasury of an excess of assets in the event that Congress fails to reach an early agreement for the reduction of taxation. I heartily approve the Secretary's recommendation of immediate and extensive reductions in the annual revenues of the Government. It will be remembered that I urged upon the attention of Congress at its last session the importance of relieving the industry and enterprise of the country from the pressure of unnecessary taxation. It is one of the tritest maxims of political economy that all taxes are burdensome, however wisely and prudently imposed; and though there have always been among our people wide differences of sentiment as to the best methods of raising the national revenues, and, indeed, as to the principles upon which taxation should be based, there has been substantial accord in the doctrine that only such taxes ought to be levied as are necessary for a wise and economical administration of the Government. Of late the public revenues have far exceeded that limit, and unless checked by. appropriate legislation such excess will continue to increase from year to year. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1881, the surplus revenue amounted to $ 100,000,000; for the fiscal year ended on the 30th of June last the surplus was more than one hundred and forty-five millions. The report of the Secretary shows what disposition has been made of these moneys. They have not only answered the requirements of the sinking fund, but have afforded a large balance applicable to other reductions of the public debt. But I renew the expression of my conviction that such rapid extinguishment of the national indebtedness as is now taking place is by no means a cause for congratulation; it is a cause rather for serious apprehension. If it continues, it must speedily be followed by one of the evil results so clearly set forth in the report of the Secretary. Either the surplus must lie idle in the Treasury or the Government will be forced to buy at market rates its bonds not then redeemable, and which under such circumstances can not fail to command an enormous premium, or the swollen revenues will be devoted to extravagant expenditure, which, as experience has taught, is ever the bane of an overflowing treasury. It was made apparent in the course of the animated discussions which this question aroused at the last session of Congress that the policy of diminishing the revenue by reducing taxation commanded the general approval of the members of both Houses. I regret that because of conflicting views as to the best methods by which that policy should be made operative none of its benefits have as yet been reaped. In fulfillment of what I deem my constitutional duty, but with little hope that I can make valuable contribution to this vexed question, I shall proceed to intimate briefly my own views in relation to it. Upon the showing of our financial condition at the close of the last fiscal year, I felt justified in recommending to Congress the abolition of all internal revenue taxes except those upon tobacco in its various forms and upon distilled spirits and fermented liquors, and except also the special tax upon the manufacturers of and dealers in such articles. I venture now to suggest that unless it shall be ascertained that the probable expenditures of the Government for the coming year have been underestimated all internal taxes save those which relate to distilled spirits can be prudently abrogated. Such a course, if accompanied by a simplification of the machinery of collection, which would then be easy of accomplishment, might reasonably be expected to result in diminishing the cost of such collection by at least $ 2,500,000 and in the retirement from office of from 1,500 to 2,000 persons. The system of excise duties has never commended itself to the favor of the American people, and has never been resorted to except for supplying deficiencies in the Treasury when, by reason of special exigencies, the duties on imports have proved inadequate for the needs of the Government. The sentiment of the country doubtless demands that the present excise tax shall be abolished as soon as such a course can be safely pursued. It seems to me, however, that, for various reasons, so sweeping a measure as the total abolition of internal taxes would for the present be an unwise step. Two of these reasons are deserving of special mention: First. It is by no means clear that even if the existing system of duties on imports is continued without modification those duties alone will yield sufficient revenue for all the needs of the Government. It is estimated that $ 100,000,000 will be required for pensions during the coming year, and it may well be doubted whether the maximum annual demand for that object has yet been reached. Uncertainty upon this question would alone justify, in my judgment, the retention for the present of that portion of the system of internal revenue which is least objectionable to the people. Second. A total abolition of excise taxes would almost inevitably prove a serious if not an insurmountable obstacle to a thorough revision of the tariff and to any considerable reduction in import duties. The present tariff system is in many respects unjust. It makes unequal distributions both of its burdens and its benefits. This fact was practically recognized by a majority of each House of Congress in the passage of the act creating the Tariff Commission. The report of that commission will be placed before you at the beginning of this session, and will, I trust, afford you such information as to the condition and prospects of the various commercial, agricultural, manufacturing, mining, and other interests of the country and contain such suggestions for statutory revision as will practically aid your action upon this important subject. The revenue from customs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879, amounted to $ 137,000,000. It has in the three succeeding years reached, first, $ 186,000,000, then $ 198,000,000, and finally, as has been already stated, $ 220,000,000. The income from this source for the fiscal year which will end on June 30, 1883, will doubtless be considerably in excess of the sum last mentioned. If the tax on domestic spirits is to be retained, it is plain, therefore, that large reductions from the customs revenue are entirely feasible. While recommending this reduction, I am far from advising the abandonment of the policy of so discriminating in the adjustment of details as to afford aid and protection to domestic labor. But the present system should be so revised as to equalize the public burden among all classes and occupations and bring it into closer harmony with the present needs of industry. Without entering into minute detail, which under present circumstances is quite unnecessary, I recommend an enlargement of the free list so as to include within it the numerous articles which yield inconsiderable revenue, a simplification of the complex and inconsistent schedule of duties upon certain manufactures, particularly those of cotton, iron, and steel, and a substantial reduction of the duties upon those articles and. upon sugar, molasses, silk, wool, and woolen goods. If a general revision of the tariff shall be found to be impracticable at this session, I express the hope that at least some of the more conspicuous inequalities of the present law may be corrected before your final adjournment. One of them is specially referred to by the Secretary. In view of a recent decision of the Supreme Court, the necessity of amending the law by which the Dutch standard of color is adopted as the test of the saccharine strength of sugars is too obvious to require comment. From the report of the Secretary of War it appears that the only outbreaks of Indians during the past year occurred in Arizona and in the southwestern part of New Mexico. They were promptly quelled, and the quiet which has prevailed in all other parts of the country has permitted such an addition to be made to the military force in the region endangered by the Apaches that there is little reason to apprehend trouble in the future. Those parts of the Secretary's report which relate to our seacoast defenses and their armament suggest the gravest reflections. Our existing fortifications are notoriously inadequate to the defense of the great harbors and cities for whose protection they were built. The question of providing an armament suited to our present necessities has been the subject of consideration by a board, whose report was transmitted to Congress at the last session. Pending the consideration of that report, the War Department has taken no steps for the manufacture or conversion of any heavy cannon, but the Secretary expresses the hope that authority and means to begin that important work will be soon provided. I invite the attention of Congress to the propriety of making more adequate provision for arming and equipping the militia than is afforded by the act of 1808, which is still upon the statute book. The matter has already been the subject of discussion in the Senate, and a bill which seeks to supply the deficiencies of existing laws is now upon its calendar. The Secretary of War calls attention to an embarrassment growing out of the recent act of Congress making the retirement of officers of the Army compulsory at the age of 64. The act of 1878 is still in force, which limits to 400 the number of those who can be retired for disability or upon their own application. The two acts, when construed together, seem to forbid the relieving, even for absolute incapacity, of officers who do not fall within the purview of the later statute, save at such times as there chance to be less than 40 names on the retired list. There are now 420. It is not likely that Congress intended this result, and I concur with the Secretary that the law ought to be amended. The grounds that impelled me to withhold my signature from the bill entitled \\u201cAn act making appropriations for the construction, repair, and preservation of certain works on rivers and harbors,\\u201d which became a law near the close of your last session, prompt me to express the hope that no similar measure will be deemed necessary during the present session of Congress. Indeed, such a measure would now be open to a serious objection in addition to that which was lately urged upon your attention. I am informed by the Secretary of War that the greater portion of the sum appropriated for the various items specified in that act remains unexpended. Of the new works which it authorized, expenses have been incurred upon two only, for which the total appropriation was $ 210,000. The present available balance is disclosed by the following table: Amount of appropriation by act of August 2, 1882 $ 18,738,875 Amount of appropriation by act of June 19, 1882 10,000 Amount of appropriation for payments to J. B. Eads 304,000 Unexpended balance of former appropriations 4,738,263 23,791,130 Less amount drawn from Treasury between July 1, 1882, andNovember 30, 1882 6,056,194 403,525,250.28 The is apparent by this exhibit that so far as concerns most of the items to which the act of August 2, 1882, relates there can be no need of further appropriations until after the close of the present session. If, however, any action should seem to be necessary in respect to particular objects, it will be entirely feasible to provide for those objects by appropriate legislation. It is possible, for example, that a delay until the assembling of the next Congress to make additional provision for the Mississippi River improvements might be attended with serious consequences. If such should appear to be the case, a just bill relating to that subject would command my approval. This leads me to offer a suggestion which I trust will commend itself to the wisdom of Congress. Is it not advisable that grants of considerable sums of money for diverse and independent schemes of internal improvement should be made the subjects of separate and distinct legislative enactments? It will scarcely be gainsaid, even by those who favor the most liberal expenditures for such purposes as are sought to be accomplished by what is commonly called the river and harbor bill, that the practice of grouping in such a bill appropriations for a great diversity of objects, widely separated either in their nature or in the locality with which they are concerned, or in both, is one which is much to be deprecated unless it is irremediable. It inevitably tends to secure the success of the bill as a whole, though many of the items, if separately considered, could scarcely fail of rejection. By the adoption of the course I have recommended every member of Congress, whenever opportunity should arise for giving his influence and vote for meritorious appropriations, would be enabled so to do without being called upon to sanction others undeserving his approval. So also would the Executive be afforded thereby full opportunity to exercise his constitutional prerogative of opposing whatever appropriations seemed to him objectionable without imperiling the success of others which commended themselves to his judgment. It may be urged in opposition to these suggestions that the number of works of internal improvement which are justly entitled to governmental aid is so great as to render impracticable separate appropriation bills therefor, or even for such comparatively limited number as make disposition of large sums of money. This objection may be well founded, and, whether it be or not, the advantages which would be likely to ensue from the adoption of the course I have recommended may perhaps be more effectually attained by another, which I respectfully submit to Congress as an alternative proposition. It is provided by the constitutions of fourteen of our States that the executive may disapprove any item or items of a bill appropriating money, whereupon the part of the bill approved shall be law and the part disapproved shall fail to become law unless repassed according to the provisions prescribed for the passage of bills over the veto of the executive. The States wherein some such provision as the foregoing is a part of the fundamental law are Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia. I commend to your careful consideration the question whether an amendment of the Federal Constitution in the particular indicated would not afford the best remedy for what is often a grave embrassment both to members of Congress and to the Executive, and is sometimes a serious public mischief. The report of the Secretary of the Navy states the movements of the various squadrons during the year, in home and foreign waters, where our officers and seamen, with such ships as we possess, have continued to illustrate the high character and excellent discipline of the naval organization. On the 21st of December, 1881, information was received that the exploring steamer Jeannette had been crushed and abandoned in the Arctic Ocean. The officers and crew, after a journey over the ice, embarked in three boats for the coast of Siberia. One of the parties, under the command of Chief Engineer George W. Melville, reached the land, and, falling in with the natives, was saved. Another, under Lieutenant-Commander De Long, landed in a barren region near the mouth of the Lena River. After six weeks had elapsed all but two of the number had died from fatigue and starvation. No tidings have been received from the party in the third boat, under the command of Lieutenant Chipp, but a long and fruitless investigation leaves little doubt that all its members perished at sea. As a slight tribute to their heroism I give in this communication the names of the gallant men who sacrificed their lives on this expedition: Lieutenant-Commander George W. De Long, Surgeon James M. Ambler, Jerome J. Collins, Hans Halmer Erichsen, Heinrich H. Kaacke, George W. Boyd, Walter Lee, Adolph Dressier, Carl A. Gortz, Nelse Iverson, the cook Ah Sam, and the Indian Alexy. The officers and men in the missing boat were Lieutenant Charles W. Chipp, commanding; William Dunbar, Alfred Sweetman, Waiter Sharvell, Albert C. Kuehne, Edward Star, Henry D. Warren, and Peter E. Johnson. Lieutenant Giles B. Harber and Master Willliam H. Scheutze are now bringing home the remains of Lieutenant De Long and his comrades, in pursuance of the directions of Congress. The Rodgers, fitted out for the releif of the Jeannette in accordance with the act of Congress of March 3, 1881, sailed from San Francisco June 16 under the command of Lieutenant Robert M. Berry. On November 30 she was accidentally destroyed by fire while in winter quarters in St. Lawrence Bay, but the officers and crew succeeded in escaping to the shore. Lieutenant Berry and one of his officers, after making a search for the Jeannette along the coast of Siberia, fell in with Chief Engineer Melville's party and returned home by way of Europe. The other officers and the crew of the Rodgers were brought from St. Lawrence Bay by the whaling steamer North Star. Master Charles F. Putnam, who had been placed in charge of a depot of supplies at Cape Serdze, returning to his post from St. Lawrence Bay across the ice in a blinding snow storm, was carried out to sea and lost, notwithstanding all efforts to rescue him. It appears by the Secretary's report that the available naval force of the United States consists of 37 cruisers, 14 single-turreted monitors, built during the rebellion, a large number of smoothbore guns and Parrott rifles, and 87 rifled cannon. The cruising vessels should be gradually replaced by iron or steel ships, the monitors by modern armored vessels, and the armament by high-power rifled guns. The reconstruction of our Navy, which was recommended in my last message, was begun by Congress authorizing, in its recent act, the construction of two large unarmored steel vessels of the character recommended by the late Naval Advisory Board, and subject to the final approval of a new advisory board to be organized as provided by that act. I call your attention to the recommendation of the Secretary and the board that authority be given to construct two more cruisers of smaller dimensions and one fleet dispatch vessel, and that appropriations be made for high-power rifled cannon for the torpedo service and for other harbor defenses. Pending the consideration by Congress of the policy to be hereafter adopted in conducting the eight large navy-yards and their expensive establishments, the Secretary advocates the reduction of expenditures therefor to the lowest possible amounts. For the purpose of affording the officers and seamen of the Navy opportunities for exercise and discipline in their profession, under appropriate control and direction, the Secretary advises that the Light-House Service and Coast Survey be transferred, as now organized, from the Treasury to the Navy Department; and he also suggests, for the reasons which he assigns, that a similar transfer may wisely be made of the cruising revenue vessels. The Secretary forcibly depicts the intimate connection and interdependence of the Navy and the commercial marine, and invites attention to the continued decadence of the latter and the corresponding transfer of our growing commerce to foreign bottoms. This subject is one of the utmost importance to the national welfare. Methods of reviving American shipbuilding and of restoring the United States flag in the ocean carrying trade should receive the immediate attention of Congress. We have mechanical skill and abundant material for the manufacture of modern iron steamships in fair competition with our commercial rivals. Our disadvantage in building ships is the greater cost of labor, and in sailing them, higher taxes, and greater interest on capital, while the ocean highways are already monopolized by our formidable competitors. These obstacles should in some way be overcome, and for our rapid communication with foreign lands we should not continue to depend wholly upon vessels built in the yards of other countries and sailing under foreign flags. With no United States steamers on the principal ocean lines or in any foreign ports, our facilities for extending our commerce are greatly restricted, while the nations which build and sail the ships and carry the mails and passengers obtain thereby conspicuous advantages in increasing their trade. The report of the Postmaster-General gives evidence of the satisfactory condition of that Department and contains many valuable data and accompanying suggestions which can not fail to be of interest. The information which it affords that the receipts for the fiscal year have exceeded the expenditures must be very gratifying to Congress and to the people of the country. As matters which may fairly claim particular attention, I refer you to his observations in reference to the advisability of changing the present basis for fixing salaries and allowances, of extending the money-order system, and of enlarging the functions of the postal establishment so as to put under its control the telegraph system of the country, though from this last and most important recommendation I must withhold my concurrence. At the last session of Congress several bills were introduced into the House of Representatives for the reduction of letter postage to the rate of 2 cents per half ounce. I have given much study and reflection to this subject, and am thoroughly persuaded that such a reduction would be for the best interests of the public. It has been the policy of the Government from its foundation to defray as far as possible the expenses of carrying the mails by a direct tax in the form of postage. It has never been claimed, however, that this service ought to be productive of a net revenue. As has been stated already, the report of the Postmaster-General shows that there is now a very considerable surplus in his Department and that henceforth the receipts are likely to increase at a much greater ratio than the necessary expenditures. Unless some change is made in the existing laws, the profits of the postal service will in a very few years swell the revenues of the Government many millions of dollars. The time seems auspicious, therefore, for some reduction in the rates of postage. In what shall that reduction consist? A review of the legislation which has been had upon this subject during the last thirty years discloses that domestic letters constitute the only class of mail matter which has never been favored by a substantial reduction of rates. I am convinced that the burden of maintaining the service falls most unequally upon that class, and that more than any other it is entitled to present relief. That such relief may be extended without detriment to other public interests wilt be discovered upon reviewing the results of former reductions. Immediately prior to the act of 1845 the postage upon a letter composed of a single sheet was as follows: If conveyed Cents 30 miles or less 6 Between 30 and 80 miles 10 Between 80 and 150 miles 12 1/2 Between 150 and 400 miles 18 3/4 Over 400 miles be: ( 1 the act of 1845 the postage upon a single letter conveyed for any distance under 300 miles was fixed at 5 cents and for any greater distance at 10 cents. By the act of 1851 it was provided that a single letter, if prepaid, should be carried any distance not exceeding 3,000 miles for 3 cents and any greater distance for 6 cents. It will be noticed that both of these reductions were of a radical character and relatively quite as important as that which is now proposed. In each case there ensued a temporary loss of revenue, but a sudden and large influx of business, which substantially repaired that loss within three years. Unless the experience of past legislation in this country and elsewhere goes for naught, it may be safely predicted that the stimulus of 33 1/3 per cent reduction in the tax for carriage would at once increase the number of letters consigned to the mails. The advantages of secrecy would lead to a very general substitution of sealed packets for postal cards and open circulars, and in divers other ways the volume of first class matter would be enormously augmented. Such increase amounted in England, in the first year after the adoption of penny postage, to more than 125 per cent. As a result of careful estimates, the details of which can not be here set out, I have become convinced that the deficiency for the first year after the proposed reduction would not exceed 7 per cent of the expenditures, or $ 3,000,000, while the deficiency after the reduction of 1845 was more than 14 per cent, and after that of 1851 was 27 per cent. Another interesting comparison is afforded by statistics furnished me by the Post-Office Department. The act of 1845 was passed in face of the fact that there existed a deficiency of more than $ 30,000. That of 1851 was encouraged by the slight surplus of $ 132,000. The excess of revenue in the next fiscal year is likely to be $ 3,500,000. If Congress should approve these suggestions, it may be deemed desirable to supply to some extent the deficiency which must for a time result by increasing the charge for carrying merchandise, which is now only 16 cents per pound; but even without such an increase I am confident that the receipts under the diminished rates would equal the expenditures after the lapse of three or four years. The report of the Department of Justice brings anew to your notice the necessity of enlarging the present system of Federal jurisprudence so as effectually to answer the requirements of the ever-increasing litigation with which it is called upon to deal. The Attorney-General renews the suggestions of his predecessor that in the interests of justice better provision than the existing laws afford should be made in certain judicial districts for fixing the fees of witnesses and jurors. In my message of December last I referred to pending criminal proceedings growing out of alleged frauds in what is known as the star-route service of the Post-Office Department, and advised you that I had enjoined upon the Attorney-General and associate counsel, to whom the interests of the Government were intrusted, the duty of prosecuting with the utmost vigor of the law all persons who might be found chargeable with those offenses. A trial of one of these cases has since occurred. It occupied for many weeks the attention of the supreme court of this District and was conducted with great zeal and ability. It resulted in a disagreement of the jury, but the cause has been again placed upon the calendar and will shortly be retried. If any guilty persons shall finally escape punishment for their offenses, it will not be for lack of diligent and earnest efforts on the part of the prosecution. I trust that some agreement may be reached which will speedily enable Congress, with the concurrence of the Executive, to afford the commercial community the benefits of a national bankrupt law. The report of the Secretary of the Interior, with its accompanying documents, presents a full statement of the varied operations of that Department. In respect to Indian affairs nothing has occurred which has changed or seriously modified the views to which I devoted much space in a former communication to Congress. I renew the recommendations therein contained as to extending to the Indian the protection of the law, allotting land in severalty to such as desire it, and making suitable provision for the education of youth. Such provision, as the Secretary forcibly maintains, will prove unavailing unless it is broad enough to include all those who are able and willing to make use of it, and should not solely relate to intellectual training, but also to instruction in such manual labor and simple industrial arts as can be made practically available. Among other important subjects which are included within the Secretary's report, and which will doubtless furnish occasion for Congressional action, may be mentioned the neglect of the railroad companies to which large grants of land were made by the acts of 1862 and 1864 to take title thereto, and their consequent inequitable exemption from local taxation. No survey of our material condition can fail to suggest inquiries as to the moral and intellectual progress of the people. The census returns disclose an alarming state of illiteracy in certain portions of the country, where the provision for schools is grossly inadequate. It is a momentous question for the decision of Congress whether immediate and substantial aid should not be extended by the General Government for supplementing the efforts of private beneficence and of State and Territorial legislation in behalf of education. The regulation of interstate commerce has already been the subject of your deliberations. One of the incidents of the marvelous extension of the railway system of the country has been the adoption of such measures by the corporations which own or control the roads as have tended to impair the advantages of healthful competition and to make hurtful discriminations in the adjustment of freightage. These inequalities have been corrected in several of the States by appropriate legislation, the effect of which is necessarily restricted to the limits of their own territory. So far as such mischiefs affect commerce between the States or between any one of the States and a foreign country, they are subjects of national concern, and Congress alone can afford relief. The results which have thus far attended the enforcement of the recent statute for the suppression of polygamy in the Territories are reported by the Secretary of the Interior. It is not probable that any additional legislation in this regard will be deemed desirable until the effect of existing laws shall be more closely observed and studied. I congratulate you that the commissioners under whose supervision those laws have been put in operation are encouraged to believe that the evil at which they are aimed may be suppressed without resort to such radical measures as in some quarters have been thought indispensable for success. The close relation of the General Government to the Territories preparing to be great States may well engage your special attention. It is there that the Indian disturbances mainly occur and that polygamy has found room for its growth. I can not doubt that a careful survey of Territorial legislation would be of the highest utility. Life and property would become more secure. The liability of outbreaks between Indians and whites would be lessened. The public domain would be more securely guarded and better progress be made in the instruction of the young. Alaska is still without any form of civil government. If means were provided for the education of its people and for the protection of their lives and property, the immense resources of the region would invite permanent settlements and open new fields for industry and enterprise. The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture presents an account of the labors of that Department during the past year and includes information of much interest to the general public. The condition of the forests of the country and the wasteful manner in which their destruction is taking place give cause for serious apprehension. Their action in protecting the earth's surface, in modifying the extremes of climate, and in regulating and sustaining the flow of springs and streams is now well understood, and their importance in relation to the growth and prosperity of the country can not be safely disregarded. They are fast disappearing before destructive fires and the legitimate requirements of our increasing population, and their total extinction can not be long delayed unless better methods than now prevail shall be adopted for their protection and cultivation. The attention of Congress is invited to the necessity of additional legislation to secure the preservation of the valuable forests still remaining on the public domain, especially in the extreme Western States and Territories, where the necessity for their preservation is greater than in less mountainous regions, and where the prevailing dryness of the climate renders their restoration, if they are once destroyed, well nigh impossible. The communication which I made to Congress at its first session, in December last, contained a somewhat full statement of my sentiments in relation to the principles and rules which ought to govern appointments to public service. Referring to the various plans which had theretofore been the subject of discussion in the National Legislature ( plans which in the main were modeled upon the system which obtains in Great Britain, but which lacked certain of the prominent features whereby that system is distinguished ), I felt bound to intimate my doubts whether they, or any of them, would afford adequate remedy for the evils which they aimed to correct. I declared, nevertheless, that if the proposed measures should prove acceptable to Congress they would receive the unhesitating support of the Executive. Since these suggestions were submitted for your consideration there has been no legislation upon the subject to which they relate, but there has meanwhile been an increase in the public interest in that subject, and the people of the country, apparently without distinction of party, have in various ways and upon frequent occasions given expression to their earnest wish for prompt and definite action. In my judgment such action should no longer be postponed. I may add that my own sense of its pressing importance has been quickened by observation of a practical phase of the matter, to which attention has more than once been called by my predecessors. The civil list now comprises about 100,000 persons, far the larger part of whom must, under the terms of the Constitution, he selected by the President either directly or through his own appointees. In the early years of the administration of the Government the personal direction of appointments to the civil service may not have been an irksome task for the Executive, but now that the burden has increased fully a hundredfold it has become greater thin he ought to bear, and it necessarily diverts his time and attention from the proper discharge of other duties no less delicate and responsible, and which in the very nature of things can not be delegated to other hands. In the judgment of not a few who have given study and reflection to this matter, the nation has outgrown the provisions which the Constitution has established for filling the minor offices in the public service. But whatever may be thought of the wisdom or expediency of changing the fundamental law in this regard, it is certain that much relief may be afforded, not only to the President and to the heads of the Departments, but to Senators and Representatives in Congress, by discreet legislation. They would be protected in a great measure by the bill now pending before the Senate, or by any other which should embody its important features, from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor of examining conflicting claims and pretensions of candidates. I trust that before the close of the present session some decisive action may be taken for the correction of the evils which inhere in the present methods of appointment, and I assure you of my hearty cooperation in any measures which are likely to conduce to that end. As to the most appropriate term and tenure of the official life of the subordinate employees of the Government, it seems to be generally agreed that, whatever their extent or character, the one should be definite and the other stable, and that neither should be regulated by zeal in the service of party or fidelity to the fortunes of an individual. It matters little to the people at large what competent person is at the head of this department or of that bureau if they feel assured that the removal of one and the accession of another will not involve the retirement of honest and faithful subordinates whose duties are purely administrative and have no legitimate connection with the triumph of any political principles or the success of any political party or faction. It is to this latter class of officers that the Senate bill, to which I have already referred, exclusively applies. While neither that bill nor any other prominent scheme for improving the civil service concerns the higher grade of officials, who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, I feel bound to correct a prevalent misapprehension as to the frequency with which the present Executive has displaced the incumbent of an office and appointed another in his stead. It has been repeatedly alleged that he has in this particular signally departed from the course which has been pursued under recent Administrations of the Government. The facts are as follows: The whole number of Executive appointments during the four years immediately preceding Mr. Garfield's accession to the Presidency was 2,696. Of this number 244, or 9 per cent, involved the removal of previous incumbents. The ratio of removals to the whole number of appointments was much the same during each of those four years. In the first year, with 790 appointments, there were 74 removals, or 9.3 per cent; in the second, with 917 appointments, there were 85 removals, or 8.5 per cent; in the third, with 480 appointments, there were 48 removals, or 10 per cent; in the fourth, with 429 appointments, there were 37 removals, or 8.6 per cent. In the four months of President Garfield's Administration there were 390 appointments and 89 removals, or 22.7 per cent. Precisely the same number of removals ( 89 ) has taken place in the fourteen months which have since elapsed, but they constitute only 7.8 per cent of the whole number of appointments ( 1,11MADISON. By within that period and less than 2.6 of the entire list of officials ( 3,459 ), exclusive of the Army and Navy, which is filled by Presidential appointment. I declare my approval of such legislation as may be found necessary for supplementing the existing provisions of law in relation to political assessments. In July last I authorized a public announcement that employees of the Government should regard themselves as at liberty to exercise their pleasure in making or refusing to make political contributions, and that their action in that regard would in no manner affect their official status. In this announcement I acted upon the view, which I had always maintained and still maintain, that a public officer should be as absolutely free as any other citizen to give or to withhold a contribution for the aid of the political party of his choice. It has, however, been urged, and doubtless not without foundation in fact, that by solicitation of official superiors and by other modes such contributions have at times been obtained from persons whose only motive for giving has been the fear of what might befall them if they refused. It goes without saying that such contributions are not voluntary, and in my judgment their collection should be prohibited by law. A bill which will effectually suppress them will receive my cordial approval. I hope that, however numerous and urgent may be the demands upon your attention, the interests of this District will not be forgotten. The denial to its residents of the great right of suffrage in all its relations to national, State, and municipal action imposes upon Congress the duty of affording them the best administration which its wisdom can devise. The report of the District Commissioners indicates certain measures whose adoption would seem to be very desirable. 1 instance in particular those which relate to arrears of taxes, to steam railroads, and to assessments of real property. Among the questions which have been the topic of recent debate in the halls of Congress none are of greater gravity than those relating to the ascertainment of the vote for Presidential electors and the intendment of the Constitution in its provisions for devolving Executive functions upon the Vice-President when the President suffers from inability to discharge the powers and duties of his office. I trust that no embarrassments may result from a failure to determine these questions before another national election. The closing year has been replete with blessings, for which we owe to the Giver of All Good our reverent acknowledgment. For the uninterrupted harmony of our foreign relations, for the decay of sectional animosities, for the exuberance of our harvests and the triumphs of our mining and manufacturing industries, for the prevalence of health, the spread of intelligence, and the conservation of the public credit, for the growth of the country in all the elements of national greatness -for these and countless other blessings we should rejoice and be glad. I trust that under the inspiration of this great prosperity our counsels may be harmonious, and that the dictates of prudence, patriotism, justice, and economy may lead to the adoption of measures in which the Congress and the Executive may heartily unite\",\n          \"Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: The interest with which the people of the Republic anticipate the assembling of Congress and the fulfillment on that occasion of the duty imposed upon a new President is one of the best evidences of their capacity to realize the hopes of the founders of a political system at once complex and symmetrical. While the different branches of the Government are to a certain extent independent of each other, the duties of all alike have direct reference to the source of power. Fortunately, under this system no man is so high and none so humble in the scale of public station as to escape from the scrutiny or to be exempt from the responsibility which all official functions imply. Upon the justice and intelligence of the masses, in a government thus organized, is the sole reliance of the confederacy and the only security for honest and earnest devotion to its interests against the usurpations and encroachment of power on the one hand and the assaults of personal ambition on the other. The interest of which I have spoken is inseparable from an inquiring, self governing community, but stimulated, doubtless, at the present time by the unsettled condition of our relations with several foreign powers, by the new obligations resulting from a sudden extension of the field of enterprise, by the spirit with which that field has been entered and the amazing energy with which its resources for meeting the demands of humanity have been developed. Although disease, assuming at one time the characteristics of a widespread and devastating pestilence, has left its sad traces upon some portions of our country, we have still the most abundant cause for reverent thankfulness to God for an accumulation of signal mercies showered upon us as a nation. It is well that a consciousness of rapid advancement and increasing strength be habitually associated with an abiding sense of dependence upon Him who holds in His hands the destiny of men and of nations. Recognizing the wisdom of the broad principle of absolute religious toleration proclaimed in our fundamental law, and rejoicing in the benign influence which it has exerted upon our social and political condition, I should shrink from a clear duty did I fail to express my deepest conviction that we can place no secure reliance upon any apparent progress if it be not sustained by national integrity, resting upon the great truths affirmed and illustrated by divine revelation. In the midst of our sorrow for the afflicted and suffering, it has been consoling to see how promptly disaster made true neighbors of districts and cities separated widely from each other, and cheering to watch the strength of that common bond of brotherhood which unites all hearts, in all parts of this Union, when danger threatens from abroad or calamity impends over us at home. Our diplomatic relations with foreign powers have undergone no essential changesince the adjournment of the last Congress. With some of them questions of a disturbing character are still pending, but there are good reasons to believe that these may all be amicably adjusted. For some years past Great Britain has so construed the first article of the convention of the 20th of April, 1818, in regard to the fisheries on the northeastern coast, as to exclude our citizens from some of the fishing grounds to which they freely resorted for nearly a quarter of a century subsequent to the date of that treaty. The United States have never acquiesced in this construction, but have always claimed for their fishermen all the rights which they had so long enjoyed without molestation. With a view to remove all difficulties on the subject, to extend the rights of our fishermen beyond the limits fixed by the convention of 1818, and to regulate trade between the United States and the British North American Provinces, a negotiation has been opened with a fair prospect of a favorable result. To protect our fishermen in the enjoyment of their rights and prevent collision between them and British fishermen, I deemed it expedient to station a naval force in that quarter during the fishing season. Embarrassing questions have also arisen between the two Governments in regard to Central America. Great Britain has proposed to settle them by an amicable arrangement, and our minister at London is instructed to enter into negotiations on that subject. A commission for adjusting the claims of our citizens against Great Britain and those of British subjects against the United States, organized under the convention of the 8th of February last, is now sitting in London for the transaction of business. It is in many respects desirable that the boundary line between the United States and the British Provinces in the northwest, as designated in the convention of the 15th of June, 1846, and especially that part which separates the Territory of Washington from the British possessions on the north, should be traced and marked. I therefore present the subject to your notice. With France our relations continue on the most friendly footing. The extensive commerce between the United States and that country might, it is conceived, be released from some unnecessary restrictions to the mutual advantage of both parties. With a view to this object, some progress has been made in negotiating a treaty of commerce and navigation. Independently of our valuable trade with Spain, we have important political relations with her growing out of our neighborhood to the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico. I am happy to announce that since the last Congress no attempts have been made by unauthorized expeditions within the United States against either of those colonies. Should any movement be manifested within our limits, all the means at my command will be vigorously exerted to repress it. Several annoying occurrences have taken place at Havana, or in the vicinity of the island of Cuba, between our citizens and the Spanish authorities. Considering the proximity of that island to our shores, lying, as it does, in the track of trade between some of our principal cities, and the suspicious vigilance with which foreign intercourse, particularly that with the United States, is there guarded, a repetition of such occurrences may well be apprehended. As no diplomatic intercourse is allowed between our consul at Havana and the Captain-General of Cuba, ready explanations can not be made or prompt redress afforded where injury has resulted. All complaint on the part of our citizens under the present arrangement must be, in the first place, presented to this Government and then referred to Spain. Spain again refers it to her local authorities in Cuba for investigation, and postpones an answer till she has heard from those authorities. To avoid these irritating and vexatious delays, a proposition has been made to provide for a direct appeal for redress to the Captain-General by our consul in behalf of our injured fellow citizens. Hitherto the Government of Spain has declined to enter into any such arrangement. This course on her part is deeply regretted, for without some arrangement of this kind the good understanding between the two countries may be exposed to occasional interruption. Our minister at Madrid is instructed to renew the proposition and to press it again upon the consideration of Her Catholic Majesty's Government. For several years Spain has been calling the attention of this Government to a claim for losses by some of her subjects in the case of the schooner Amistad. This claim is believed to rest on the obligations imposed by our existing treaty with that country. Its justice was admitted in our diplomatic correspondence with the Spanish Government as early as March, 1847, and one of my predecessors, in his annual message of that year, recommended that provision should be made for its payment. In January last it was again submitted to Congress by the Executive. It has received a favorable consideration by committees of both branches, but as yet there has been no final action upon it. I conceive that good faith requires its prompt adjustment, and I present it to your early and favorable consideration. Martin Koszta, a Hungarian by birth, came to this country in 1850, and declared his intention in due form of law to become a citizen of the United States. After remaining here nearly two years he visited Turkey. While at Smyrna he was forcibly seized, taken on board an Austrian brig of war then lying in the harbor of that place, and there confined in irons, with the avowed design to take him into the dominions of Austria. Our consul at Smyrna and legation at Constantinople interposed for his release, but their efforts were ineffectual. While thus in prison Commander Ingraham, with the United States ship of war St. Louis, arrived at Smyrna, and after inquiring into the circumstances of the case came to the conclusion that Koszta was entitled to the protection of this Government, and took energetic and prompt measures for his release. Under an arrangement between the agents of the United States and of Austria, he was transferred to the custody of the French support at Smyrna, there to remain until he should be disposed of by the mutual agreement of the consuls of the respective Governments at that place. Pursuant to that agreement, he has been released, and is now in the United States. The Emperor of Austria has made the conduct of our officers who took part in this transaction a subject of grave complaint. Regarding Koszta as still his subject, and claiming a right to seize him within the limits of the Turkish Empire, he has demanded of this Government its consent to the surrender of the prisoner, a disavowal of the acts of its agents, and satisfaction for the alleged outrage. After a careful consideration of the case I came to the conclusion that Koszta was seized without legal authority at Smyrna; that he was wrongfully detained on board of the Austrian brig of war; that at the time of his seizure he was clothed with the nationality of the United States, and that the acts of our officers, under the circumstances of the case, were justifiable, and their conduct has been fully approved by me, and a compliance with the several demands of the Emperor of Austria has been declined. For a more full account of this transaction and my views in regard to it I refer to the correspondence between the charge d'affaires of Austria and the Secretary of State, which is herewith transmitted. The principles and policy therein maintained on the part of the United States will, whenever a proper occasion occurs, be applied and enforced. The condition of China at this time renders it probable that some important changes will occur in that vast Empire which will lead to a more unrestricted intercourse with it. The commissioner to that country who has been recently appointed is instructed to avail himself of all occasions to open and extend our commercial relations, not only with the Empire of China, but with other Asiatic nations. In 1852 an expedition was sent to Japan, under the command of Commodore Perry, for the purpose of opening commercial intercourse with that Empire. Intelligence has been received of his arrival there and of his having made known to the Emperor of Japan the object of his visit. But it is not yet ascertained how far the Emperor will be disposed to abandon his restrictive policy and open that populous country to a commercial intercourse with the United States. It has been my earnest desire to maintain friendly intercourse with the Governments upon this continent and to aid them in preserving good understanding among themselves. With Mexico a dispute has arisen as to the true boundary line between our Territory of New Mexico and the Mexican State of Chihuahua. A former commissioner of the United States, employed in running that line pursuant to the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, made a serious mistake in determining the initial point on the Rio Grande; but inasmuch as his decision was clearly a departure from the directions for tracing the boundary contained in that treaty, and was not concurred in by the surveyor appointed on the part of the United States, whose concurrence was necessary to give validity to that decision, this Government is not concluded thereby; but that of Mexico takes a different view of the subject. There are also other questions of considerable magnitude pending between the two Republics. Our minister in Mexico has ample instructions to adjust them. Negotiations have been opened, but sufficient progress has not been made therein to enable me to speak of the probable result. Impressed with the importance of maintaining amicable relations with that Republic and of yielding with liberality to all her just claims, it is reasonable to expect that an arrangement mutually satisfactory to both countries may be concluded and a lasting friendship between them confirmed and perpetuated. Congress having provided for a full mission to the States of Central America, a minister was sent thither in July last. As yet he has had time to visit only one of these States ( Nicaragua ), where he was received in the most friendly manner. It is hoped that his presence and good offices will have a benign effect in composing the dissensions which prevail among them, and in establishing still more intimate and friendly relations between them respectively and between each of them and the United States. Considering the vast regions of this continent and the number of states which would be made accessible by the free navigation of the river Amazon, particular attention has been given to this subject. Brazil, through whose territories it passes into the ocean, has hitherto persisted in a policy so restricted in regard to the use of this river as to obstruct and nearly exclude foreign commercial intercourse with the States which lie upon its tributaries and upper branches. Our minister to that country is instructed to obtain a relaxation of that policy and to use his efforts to induce the Brazilian Government to open to common use, under proper safeguards, this great natural highway for international trade. Several of the South American States are deeply interested in this attempt to secure the free navigation of the Amazon, and it is reasonable to expect their cooperation in the measure. As the advantages of free commercial intercourse among nations are better understood, more liberal views are generally entertained as to the common rights of all to the free use of those means which nature has provided for international communication. To these more liberal and enlightened views it is hoped that Brazil will conform her policy and remove all unnecessary restrictions upon the free use of a river which traverses so many states and so large a part of the continent. I am happy to inform you that the Republic of Paraguay and the Argentine Confederation have yielded to the liberal policy still resisted by Brazil in regard to the navigable rivers within their respective territories. Treaties embracing this subject, among others, have been negotiated with these Governments, which will be submitted to the Senate at the present session. A new branch of commerce, important to the agricultural interests of the United States, has within a few years past been opened with Peru. Notwithstanding the inexhaustible deposits of guano upon the islands of that country, considerable difficulties are experienced in obtaining the requisite supply. Measures have been taken to remove these difficulties and to secure a more abundant importation of the article. Unfortunately, there has been a serious collision between our citizens who have resorted to the Chincha Islands for it and the Peruvian authorities stationed there. Redress for the outrages committed by the latter was promptly demanded by our minister at Lima. This subject is now under consideration, and there is reason to believe that Peru is disposed to offer adequate indemnity to the aggrieved parties. We are thus not only at peace with all foreign countries, but, in regard to political affairs, are exempt from any cause of serious disquietude in our domestic relations. The controversies which have agitated the country heretofore are passing away with the causes which produced them and the passions which they had awakened; or, if any trace of them remains, it may be reasonably hoped that it will only be perceived in the zealous rivalry of all good citizens to testify their respect for the rights of the States, their devotion to the Union, and their common determination that each one of the States, its institutions, its welfare, and its domestic peace, shall be held alike secure under the sacred aegis of the Constitution. This new league of amity and of mutual confidence and support into which the people of the Republic have entered happily affords inducement and opportunity for the adoption of a more comprehensive and unembarrassed line of policy and action as to the great material interests of the country, whether regarded in themselves or in connection with the powers of the civilized world. The United States have continued gradually and steadily to expand through acquisitions of territory, which, how much soever some of them may have been questioned, are now universally seen and admitted to have been wise in policy, just in character, and a great element in the advancement of our country, and with it of the human race, in freedom, in prosperity, and in happiness. The thirteen States have grown to be thirty one, with relations reaching to Europe on the one side and on the other to the distant realms of Asia. I am deeply sensible of the immense responsibility which the present magnitude of the Republic and the diversity and multiplicity of its interests devolves upon me, the alleviation of which so far as relates to the immediate conduct of the public business, is, first, in my reliance on the wisdom and patriotism of the two Houses of Congress, and, secondly, in the directions afforded me by the principles of public polity affirmed by our fathers of the epoch of 1798, sanctioned by long experience, and consecrated anew by the overwhelming voice of the people of the United States. Recurring to these principles, which constitute the organic basis of union, we perceive that vast as are the functions and the duties of the Federal Government, vested in or intrusted to its three great departments the legislative, executive, and judicial yet the substantive power, the popular force, and the large capacities for social and material development exist in the respective States, which, all being of themselves well constituted republics, as they preceded so they alone are capable of maintaining and perpetuating the American Union. The Federal Government has its appropriate line of action in the specific and limited powers conferred on it by the Constitution, chiefly as to those things in which the States have a common interest in their relations to one another and to foreign governments, while the great mass of interests which belong to cultivated men the ordinary business of life, the springs of industry, all the diversified personal and domestic affairs of society rest securely upon the general reserved powers of the people of the several States. There is the effective democracy of the nation, and there the vital essence of its being and its greatness. Of the practical consequences which flow from the nature of the Federal Government, the primary one is the duty of administering with integrity and fidelity the high trust reposed in it by the Constitution, especially in the application of the public funds as drawn by taxation from the people and appropriated to specific objects by Congress. Happily, I have no occasion to suggest any radical changes in the financial policy of the Government. Ours is almost, if not absolutely, the solitary power of Christendom having a surplus revenue drawn immediately from imposts on commerce, and therefore measured by the spontaneous enterprise and national prosperity of the country, with such indirect relation to agriculture, manufactures, and the products of the earth and sea as to violate no constitutional doctrine and yet vigorously promote the general welfare. Neither as to the sources of the public treasure nor as to the manner of keeping and managing it does any grave controversy now prevail, there being a general acquiescence in the wisdom of the present system. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury will exhibit in detail the state of the public finances and the condition of the various branches of the public service administered by that Department of the Government. The revenue of the country, levied almost insensibly to the taxpayer, goes on from year to year, increasing beyond either the interests or the prospective wants of the Government. At the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1852, there remained in the Treasury a balance of $ 14,632,136. The public revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1853, amounted to $ 58,931,865 from customs and to $ 2,405,708 from public lands and other miscellaneous sources, amounting together to $ 61,337,574, while the public expenditures for the same period, exclusive of payments on account of the public debt, amounted to $ 43,554,262, leaving a balance of $ 32,425,447 of receipts above expenditures. This fact of increasing surplus in the Treasury became the subject of anxious consideration at a very early period of my Administration, and the path of duty in regard to it seemed to me obvious and clear, namely: First, to apply the surplus revenue to the discharge of the public debt so far as it could judiciously be done, and, secondly, to devise means for the gradual reduction of the revenue to the standard of the public exigencies. Of these objects the first has been in the course of accomplishment in a manner and to a degree highly satisfactory. The amount of the public debt of all classes was on the 4th of March, 1853, $ 69,190,037, payments on account of which have been made since that period to the amount of $ 12,703,329, leaving unpaid and in continuous course of liquidation the sum of $ 56,486,708. These payments, although made at the market price of the respective classes of stocks, have been effected readily and to the general advantage of the Treasury, and have at the same time proved of signal utility in the relief they have incidentally afforded to the money market and to the industrial and commercial pursuits of the country. The second of the aftereffect objects, that of the reduction of the tariff, is of great importance, and the plan suggested by the Secretary of the Treasury, which is to reduce the duties on certain articles and to add to the free list many articles now taxed, and especially such as enter into manufactures and are not largely, or at all, produced in the country, is commended to your candid and careful consideration. You will find in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, also, abundant proof of the entire adequacy of the present fiscal system to meet all the requirements of the public service, and that, while properly administered, it operates to the advantage of the community in ordinary business relations. I respectfully ask your attention to sundry suggestions of improvements in the settlement of accounts, especially as regards the large sums of outstanding arrears due to the Government, and of other reforms in the administrative action of his Department which are indicated by the Secretary; as also to the progress made in the construction of marine hospitals, custom houses, and of a new mint in California and assay office in the city of New York, heretofore provided for by Congress, and also to the eminently successful progress of the Coast Survey and of the Light House Board. Among the objects meriting your attention will be important recommendations from the Secretaries of War and Navy. I am fully satisfied that the Navy of the United States is not in a condition of strength and efficiency commensurate with the magnitude of our commercial and other interests, and commend to your especial attention the suggestions on this subject made by the Secretary of the Navy. I respectfully submit that the Army, which under our system must always be regarded with the highest interest as a nucleus around which the volunteer forces of the nation gather in the hour of danger, requires augmentation, or modification, to adapt it to the present extended limits and frontier relations of the country and the condition of the Indian tribes in the interior of the continent, the necessity of which will appear in the communications of the Secretaries of War and the Interior. In the administration of the Post-Office Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1853, the gross expenditure was $ 7,982,756, and the gross receipts during the same period $ 5,942,734, showing that the current revenue failed to meet the current expenses of the Department by the sum of $ 2,042,032. The causes which, under the present postal system and laws, led inevitably to this result are fully explained by the report of the Postmaster-General, one great cause being the enormous rates the Department has been compelled to pay for mail service rendered by railroad companies. The exhibit in the report of the Postmaster-General of the income and expenditures by mail steamers will be found peculiarly interesting and of a character to demand the immediate action of Congress. Numerous and flagrant frauds upon the Pension Bureau have been brought to light within the last year, and in some instances merited punishments inflicted; but, unfortunately, in others guilty parties have escaped, not through the want of sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction, but in consequence of the provisions of limitation in the existing laws. From the nature of these claims, the remoteness of the tribunals to pass upon them, and the mode in which the proof is of necessity furnished, temptations to crime have been greatly stimulated by the obvious difficulties of detection. The defects in the law upon this subject are so apparent and so fatal to the ends of justice that your early action relating to it is most desirable. During the last fiscal year 9,819,411 acres of the public lands have been surveyed and 10,363,891 acres brought into market. Within the same period the sales by public purchase and private entry amounted to 1,083,495 acres; located under military bountys and warrants, 6,142,360 acres; located under other certificates, 9,427 acres; ceded to the States as swamp lands, 16,684,253 acres; selected for railroad and other objects under acts of Congress, 1,427,457 acres: total amount of lands disposed of within the fiscal year, 25,346,992 acres, which is an increase in quantity sold and located under land warrants and grants of 12,231, 818 acres over the fiscal year immediately preceding. The quantity of land sold during the second and third quarters of 1852 was 334,451 acres; the amount received therefor was $ 623,687. The quantity sold the second and third quarters of the year 1853 was 1,609,919 acres, and the amount received therefor $ 2,226,876. The whole number of land warrants issued under existing laws prior to the 30th of September last was 266,042, of which there were outstanding at that date 66,947. The quantity of land required to satisfy these outstanding warrants is 4,778,120 acres. Warrants have been issued to 30th of September last under the act of 11th February, 1847, calling for 12,879,280 acres, under acts of September 28, 1850, and March 22, 1852, calling for 12,505,360 acres, making a total of 25,384,640 acres. It is believed that experience has verified the wisdom and justice of the present system with regard to the public domain in most essential particulars. You will perceive from the report of the Secretary of the Interior that opinions which have often been expressed in relation to the operation of the land system as not being a source of revenue to the Federal Treasury were erroneous. The net profits from the sale of the public lands to June 30, 1853, amounted to the sum of $ 53,289,465. I recommend the extension of the land system over the Territories of Utah and New Mexico, with such modifications as their peculiarities may require. Regarding our public domain as chiefly valuable to provide homes for the industrious and enterprising, I am not prepared to recommend any essential change in the land system, except by modifications in favor of the actual settler and an extension of the preemption principle in certain cases, for reasons and on grounds which will be fully developed in the reports to be laid before you. Congress, representing the proprietors of the territorial domain and charged especially with power to dispose of territory belonging to the United States, has for a long course of years, beginning with the Administration of Mr. Jefferson, exercised the power to construct roads within the Territories, and there are so many and obvious distinctions between this exercise of power and that of making roads within the States that the former has never been considered subject to such objections as apply to the latter; and such may now be considered the settled construction of the power of the Federal Government upon the subject. Numerous applications have been and no doubt will continue to be made for grants of land in aid of the construction of railways. It is not believed to be within the intent and meaning of the Constitution that the power to dispose of the public domain should be used otherwise than might be expected from a prudent proprietor and therefore that grants of land to aid in the construction of roads should be restricted to cases where it would be for the interest of a proprietor under like circumstances thus to contribute to the construction of these works. For the practical operation of such grants thus far in advancing the interests ot the States in which the works are located, and at the same time the substantial interests of all the other States, by enhancing the value and promoting the rapid sale of the public domain, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior. A careful examination, however, will show that this experience is the result of a just discrimination and will be far from affording encouragement to a reckless or indiscriminate extension of the principle. I commend to your favorable consideration the men of genius of our country who by their inventions and discoveries in science and arts have contributed largely to the improvements of the age without, in many instances, securing for themselves anything like an adequate reward. For many interesting details upon this subject I refer you to the appropriate reports, and especially urge upon your early attention the apparently slight, but really important, modifications of existing laws therein suggested. The liberal spirit which has so long marked the action of Congress in relation to the District of Columbia will, I have no doubt, continue to be manifested. The erection of an asylum for the insane of the District of Columbia and of the Army and Navy of the United States has been somewhat retarded by the great demand for materials and labor during the past summer, but full preparation for the reception of patients before the return of another winter is anticipated; and there is the best reason to believe, from the plan and contemplated arrangements which have been devised, with the large experience furnished within the last few years in relation to the nature and treatment of the disease, that it will prove an asylum indeed to this most helpless and afflicted class of sufferers and stand as a noble monument of wisdom and mercy. Under the acts of Congress of August 31, 1852, and of March 3, 1853, designed to secure for the cities of Washington and Georgetown an abundant supply of good and wholesome water, it became my duty to examine the report and plans of the engineer who had charge of the surveys under the act first named. The best, if not the only, plan calculated to secure permanently the object sought was that which contemplates taking the water from the Great Falls of the Potomac, and consequently I gave to it my approval. For the progress and present condition of this important work and for its demands so far as appropriations are concerned I refer you to the report of the Secretary of War. The present judicial system of the United States has now been in operation for so long a period of time and has in its general theory and much of its details become so familiar to the country and acquired so entirely the public confidence that if modified in any respect it should only be in those particulars which may adapt it to the increased extent, population, and legal business of the United States. In this relation the organization of the courts is now confessedly inadequate to the duties to be performed by them, in consequence of which the States of Florida, Wisconsin, Iowa, Texas, and California, and districts of other States, are in effect excluded from the full benefits of the general system by the functions of the circuit court being devolved on the district judges in all those States or parts of States. The spirit of the Constitution and a due regard to justice require that all the States of the Union should be placed on the same footing in regard to the judicial tribunals. I therefore commend to your consideration this important subject, which in my judgment demands the speedy action of Congress. I will present to you, if deemed desirable, a plan which I am prepared to recommend for the enlargement and modification of the present judicial system. The act of Congress establishing the Smithsonian Institution provided that the President of the United States and other persons therein designated should constitute an \\u201cestablishment\\u201d by that name, and that the members should hold stated and special meetings for the supervision of the affairs of the Institution. The organization not having taken place, it seemed to me proper that it should be effected without delay. This has been done; and an occasion was thereby presented for inspecting the condition of the Institution and appreciating its successful progress thus far and its high promise of great and general usefulness. I have omitted to ask your favorable consideration for the estimates of works of a local character in twenty-seven of the thirty one States, amounting to $ 1,754,500, because, independently of the grounds which have so often been urged against the application of the Federal revenue for works of this character, inequality, with consequent injustice, is inherent in the nature of the proposition, and because the plan has proved entirely inadequate to the accomplishment of the objects sought. The subject of internal improvements, claiming alike the interest and good will of all, has, nevertheless, been the basis of much political discussion and has stood as a deep-graven line of division between statesmen of eminent ability and patriotism. The rule of strict construction of all powers delegated by the States to the General Government has arrayed itself from time to time against the rapid progress of expenditures from the National Treasury on works of a local character within the States. Memorable as an epoch in the history of this subject is the message of President Jackson of the 27th of May, 1830, which met the system of internal improvements in its comparative infancy; but so rapid had been its growth that the projected appropriations in that year for works of this character had risen to the alarming amount of more than $ 166,281,505.55 The that message the President admitted the difficulty of bringing back the operations of the Government to the construction of the Constitution set up in 1798, and marked it as an admonitory proof of the necessity of guarding that instrument with sleepless vigilance against the authority of precedents which had not the sanction of its most plainly defined powers. Our Government exists under a written compact between sovereign States, uniting for specific objects and with specific grants to their general agent. If, then, in the progress of its administration there have been departures from the terms and intent of the compact, it is and will ever be proper to refer back to the fixed standard which our fathers left us and to make a stern effort to conform our action to it. It would seem that the fact of a principle having been resisted from the first by many of the wisest and most patriotic men of the Republic, and a policy having provoked constant strife without arriving at a conclusion which can be regarded as satisfactory to its most earnest advocates, should suggest the inquiry whether there may not be a plan likely to be crowned by happier results. Without perceiving any sound distinction or intending to assert any principle as opposed to improvements needed for the protection of internal commerce which does not equally apply to improvements upon the seaboard for the protection of foreign commerce, I submit to you whether it may not be safely anticipated that if the policy were once settled against appropriations by the General Government for local improvements for the benefit of commerce, localities requiring expenditures would not, by modes and means clearly legitimate and proper, raise the fund necessary for such constructions as the safety or other interests of their commerce might require. If that can be regarded as a system which in the experience of mere than thirty years has at no time so commanded the public judgment as to give it the character of a settled policy; which, though it has produced some works of conceded importance, has been attended with an expenditure quite disproportionate to their value and has resulted in squandering large sums upon objects which have answered no valuable purpose, the interests of all the States require it to be abandoned unless hopes may be indulged for the future which find no warrant in the past. With an anxious desire for the completion of the works which are regarded by all good citizens with sincere interest, I have deemed it my duty to ask at your hands a deliberate reconsideration of the question, with a hope that, animated by a desire to promote the permanent and substantial interests of the country, your wisdom may prove equal to the task of devising and maturing a plan which, applied to this subject, may promise something better than constant strife, the suspension of the powers of local enterprise, the exciting of vain hopes, and the disappointment of cherished expectations. In expending the appropriations made by the last Congress several cases have arisen in relation to works for the improvement of harbors which involve questions as to the right of soil and jurisdiction, and have threatened conflict between the authority of the State and General Governments. The right to construct a breakwater, jetty, or dam would seem necessarily to carry with it the power to protect and preserve such constructions. This can only be effectually done by having jurisdiction over the soil. But no clause of the Constitution is found on which to rest the claim of the United States to exercise jurisdiction over the soil of a State except that conferred by the eighth section of the first article of the Constitution. It is, then, submitted whether, in all cases where constructions are to be erected by the General Government, the right of soil should not first be obtained and legislative provision be made to cover all such cases. For the progress made in the construction of roads within the Territories, as provided for in the appropriations of the last Congress, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of War. There is one subject of a domestic nature which, from its intrinsic importance and the many interesting questions of future policy which it involves, can not fail to receive your early attention. I allude to the means of communication by which different parts of the wide expanse of our country are to be placed in closer connection for purposes both of defense and commercial intercourse, and more especially such as appertain to the communication of those great divisions of the Union which lie on the opposite sides of the Rocky Mountains. That the Government has not been unmindful of this heretofore is apparent from the aid it has afforded through appropriations for mail facilities and other purposes. But the general subject will now present itself under aspects more imposing and more purely national by reason of the surveys ordered by Congress, and now in the process of completion, for communication by railway across the continent, and wholly within the limits of the United States. The power to declare war, to raise and support armies, to provide and maintain a navy, and to call forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions was conferred upon Congress as means to provide for the common defense and to protect a territory and a population now widespread and vastly multiplied. As incidental to and indispensable for the exercise of this power, it must sometimes be necessary to construct military roads and protect harbors of refuge. To appropriations by Congress for such objects no sound objection can be raised. Happily for our country, its peaceful policy and rapidly increasing population impose upon us no urgent necessity for preparation, and leave but few trackless deserts between assailable points and a patriotic people ever ready and generally able to protect them. These necessary links the enterprise and energy of our people are steadily and boldly struggling to supply. All experience affirms that wherever private enterprise will avail it is most wise for the General Government to leave to that and individual watchfulness the location and execution of all means of communication. The surveys before alluded to were designed to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the river Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean. Parties are now in the field making explorations, where previous examinations had not supplied sufficient data and where there was the best reason to hope the object sought might be found. The means and time being both limited, it is not to be expected that all the accurate knowledge desired will be obtained, but it is hoped that much and important information will be added to the stock previously possessed, and that partial, if not full, reports of the surveys ordered will be received in time for transmission to the two Houses of Congress on or before the first Monday in February next, as required by the act of appropriation. The magnitude of the enterprise contemplated has aroused and will doubtless continue to excite a very general interest throughout the country. In its political, its commercial, and its military bearings it has varied, great, and increasing claims to consideration. The heavy expense, the great delay, and, at times, fatality attending travel by either of the Isthmus routes have demonstrated the advantage which would result from interterritorial communication by such safe and rapid means as a railroad would supply. These difficulties, which have been encountered in a period of peace, would be magnified and still further increased in time of war. But whilst the embarrassments already encountered and others under new contingencies to be anticipated may serve strikingly to exhibit the importance of such a work, neither these nor all considerations combined can have an appreciable value when weighed against the obligation strictly to adhere to the Constitution and faithfully to execute the powers it confers. Within this limit and to the extent of the interest of the Government involved it would seem both expedient and proper if an economical and practicable route shall be found to aid by all constitutional means in the construction of a road which will unite by speedy transit the populations of the Pacific and Atlantic States. To guard against misconception, it should be remarked that although the power to construct or aid in the construction of a road within the limits of a Territory is not embarrassed by that question of jurisdiction which would arise within the limits of a State, it is, nevertheless, held to be of doubtful power and more than doubtful propriety, even within the limits of a Territory, for the General Government to undertake to administer the affairs of a railroad, a canal, or other similar construction, and therefore that its connection with a work of this character should be incidental rather than primary. I will only add at present that, fully appreciating the magnitude of the subject and solicitous that the Atlantic and Pacific shores of the Republic may be bound together by inseparable ties of common interest, as well as of common fealty and attachment to the Union, I shall be disposed, so far as my own action is concerned, to follow the lights of the Constitution as expounded and illustrated by those whose opinions and expositions constitute the standard of my political faith in regard to the powers of the Federal Government. It is, I trust, not necessary to say that no grandeur of enterprise and no present urgent inducement promising popular favor will lead me to disregard those lights or to depart from that path which experience has proved to be safe, and which is now radiant with the glow of prosperity and legitimate constitutional progress. We can afford to wait, but we can not afford to overlook the ark of our security. It is no part of my purpose to give prominence to any subject which may properly be regarded as set at rest by the deliberate judgment of the people. But while the present is bright with promise and the future full of demand and inducement for the exercise of active intelligence, the past can never be without useful lessons of admonition and instruction. If its dangers serve not as beacons, they will evidently fail to fulfill the object of a wise design. When the grave shall have closed over all who are now endeavoring to meet the obligations of duty, the year 1850 will be recurred to as a period filled with anxious apprehension. A successful war had just terminated. Peace brought with it a vast augmentation of territory. Disturbing questions arose bearing upon the domestic institutions of one portion of the Confederacy and involving the constitutional rights of the States. But notwithstanding differences of opinion and sentiment which then existed in relation to details and specific provisions, the acquiescence of distinguished citizens, whose devotion to the Union can never be doubted, has given renewed vigor to our institutions and restored a sense of repose and security to the public mind throughout the Confederacy. That this repose is to suffer no shock during my official term, if I have power to avert it, those who placed me here may be assured. The wisdom of men who knew what independence cost, who had put all at stake upon the issue of the Revolutionary struggle, disposed of the subject to which I refer in the only way consistent with the Union of these States and with the march of power and prosperity which has made us what we are. It is a significant fact that from the adoption of the Constitution until the officers and soldiers of the Revolution had passed to their graves, or, through the infirmities of age and wounds, had ceased to participate actively in public affairs, there was not merely a quiet acquiescence in, but a prompt vindication of, the constitutional rights of the States. The reserved powers were scrupulously respected. No statesman put forth the narrow views of casuists to justify interference and agitation, but the spirit of the compact was regarded as sacred in the eye of honor and indispensable for the great experiment of civil liberty, which, environed by inherent difficulties, was yet borne forward in apparent weakness by a power superior to all obstacles. There is no condemnation which the voice of freedom will not pronounce upon us should we prove faithless to this great trust. While men inhabiting different parts of this vast continent can no more be expected to hold the same opinions or entertain the same sentiments than every variety of climate or soil can be expected to furnish the same agricultural products, they can unite in a common object and sustain common principles essential to the maintenance of that object. The gallant men of the South and the North could stand together during the struggle of the Revolution; they could stand together in the more trying period which succeeded the clangor of arms. As their united valor was adequate to all the trials of the camp and dangers of the field, so their united wisdom proved equal to the greater task of founding upon a deep and broad basis institutions which it has been our privilege to enjoy and will ever be our most sacred duty to sustain. It is but the feeble expression of a faith strong and universal to say that their sons, whose blood mingled so often upon the same field during the War of 1812 and who have more recently borne in triumph the flag of the country upon a foreign soil, will never permit alienation of feeling to weaken the power of their united efforts nor internal dissensions to paralyze the great arm of freedom, uplifted for the vindication of self government. I have thus briefly presented such suggestions as seem to me especially worthy of your consideration. In providing for the present you can hardly fail to avail yourselves of the light which the experience of the past casts upon the future. The growth of our population has now brought us, in the destined career of our national history, to a point at which it well behooves us to expand our vision over the vast prospective. The successive decennial returns of the census since the adoption of the Constitution have revealed a law of steady, progressive development, which may be stated in general terms as a duplication every quarter century. Carried forward from the point already reached for only a short period of time, as applicable to the existence of a nation, this law of progress, if unchecked, will bring us to almost incredible results. A large allowance for a diminished proportional effect of emigration would not very materially reduce the estimate, while the increased average duration of human life known to have already resulted from the scientific and hygienic improvements of the past fifty years will tend to keep up through the next fifty, or perhaps hundred, the same ratio of growth which has been thus revealed in our past progress; and to the influence of these causes may be added the influx of laboring masses from eastern Asia to the Pacific side of our possessions, together with the probable accession of the populations already existing in other parts of our hemisphere, which within the period in question will feel with yearly increasing force the natural attraction of so vast, powerful, and prosperous a confederation of self governing republics and will seek the privilege of being admitted within its safe and happy bosom, transferring with themselves, by a peaceful and healthy process of incorporation, spacious regions of virgin and exuberant soil, which are destined to swarm with the fast growing and fast-spreading millions of our race. These considerations seem fully to justify the presumption that the law of population above stated will continue to act with undiminished effect through at least the next half century, and that thousands of persons who have already arrived at maturity and are now exercising the rights of freemen will close their eyes on the spectacle of more than 100,000,000 of population embraced within the majestic proportions of the American Union. It is not merely as an interesting topic of speculation that I present these views for your consideration. They have important practical bearings upon all the political duties we are called upon to perform. Heretofore our system of government has worked on what may be termed a miniature scale in comparison with the development which it must thus assume within a future so near at hand as scarcely to be beyond the present of the existing generation. It is evident that a confederation so vast and so varied, both in numbers and in territorial extent, in habits and in interests, could only be kept in national cohesion by the strictest fidelity to the principles of the Constitution as understood by those who have adhered to the most restricted construction of the powers granted by the people and the States. Interpreted and applied according to those principles, the great compact adapts itself with healthy ease and freedom to an unlimited extension of that benign system of federative self government of which it is our glorious and, I trust, immortal charter. Let us, then, with redoubled vigilance, be on our guard against yielding to the temptation of the exercise of doubtful powers, even under the pressure of the motives of conceded temporary advantage and apparent temporary expediency. The minimum of Federal government compatible with the maintenance of national unity and efficient action in our relations with the rest of the world should afford the rule and measure of construction of our powers under the general clauses of the Constitution. A spirit of strict deference to the sovereign rights and dignity of every State, rather than a disposition to subordinate the States into a provincial relation to the central authority, should characterize all our exercise of the respective powers temporarily vested in us as a sacred trust from the generous confidence of our constituents. In like manner, as a manifestly indispensable condition of the perpetuation of the Union and of the realization of that magnificent national future adverted to, does the duty become yearly stronger and clearer upon us, as citizens of the several States, to cultivate a fraternal and affectionate spirit, language, and conduct in regard to other States and in relation to the varied interests, institutions, and habits of sentiment and opinion which may respectively characterize them. Mutual forbearance, respect, and noninterference in our personal action as citizens and an enlarged exercise of the most liberal principles of comity in the public dealings of State with State, whether in legislation or in the execution of laws, are the means to perpetuate that confidence and fraternity the decay of which a mere political union, on so vast a scale, could not long survive. In still another point of view is an important practical duty suggested by this consideration of the magnitude of dimensions to which our political system, with its corresponding machinery of government, is so rapidly expanding. With increased vigilance does it require us to cultivate the cardinal virtues of public frugality and official integrity and purity. Public affairs ought to be so conducted that a settled conviction shall pervade the entire Union that nothing short of the highest tone and standard of public morality marks every part of the administration and legislation of the General Government. Thus will the federal system, whatever expansion time and progress may give it, continue more and more deeply rooted in the love and confidence of the people. That wise economy which is as far removed from parsimony as from corrupt and corrupting extravagance; that single regard for the public good which will frown upon all attempts to approach the Treasury with insidious projects of private interest cloaked under public pretexts; that sound fiscal administration which, in the legislative department, guards against the dangerous temptations incident to overflowing revenue, and, in the executive, maintains an unsleeping watchfulness against the tendency of all national expenditure to extravagance, while they are admitted elementary political duties, may, I trust, be deemed as properly adverted to and urged in view of the more impressive sense of that necessity which is directly suggested by the considerations now presented. Since the adjournment of Congress the Vice-President of the United States has passed from the scenes of earth, without having entered upon the duties of the station to which he had been called by the voice of his countrymen. Having occupied almost continuously for more than thirty years a seat in one or the other of the two Houses of Congress, and having by his singular purity and wisdom secured unbounded confidence and universal respect, his failing health was watched by the nation with painful solicitude. His loss to the country, under all the circumstances, has been justly regarded as irreparable. In compliance with the act of Congress of March 2, 1853, the oath of office was administered to him on the 24th of that month at Ariadne estate, near Matanzas, in the island of Cuba; but his strength gradually declined, and was hardly sufficient to enable him to return to his home in Alabama, where, on the 18th day of April, in the most calm and peaceful way, his long and eminently useful career was terminated. Entertaining unlimited confidence in your intelligent and patriotic devotion to the public interest, and being conscious of no motives on my part which are not inseparable from the honor and advancement of my country, I hope it may be my privilege to deserve and secure not only your cordial cooperation in great public measures, but also those relations of mutual confidence and regard which it is always so desirable to cultivate between members of coordinate branches of the Government\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

nation\\u2019s Constitution Center. I had the great privilege of being a guest here. It\\u2019s an appropriate place to make the speech I\\u2019m about to make. I attended a mass earlier today and prayed for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her family. The nation lost a heroine, an icon. They also lost a mother, a grandmother, and a matriarch. We know how hard that is, to watch a piece of your soul absorb the cruelty and the pain of the dreadful disease of cancer. I spoke to her daughter and her granddaughter last night, expressing my whole family, I mean, my whole family\\u2019s sorrow, particularly my grown granddaughters, one of whom was a student of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\u2019s daughter at Columbia. They made clear to me, daughter and granddaughter, that until the very end, Justice Ginsburg displayed the character and courage we\\u2019d expect of her. They said she held their hands and gave them strength and purpose to carry on.\\nJoe Biden: (05:13)\\nIt\\u2019s been noted that she passed away on Rosh Hashanah. By tradition, a person who dies during the Jewish new year is considered a soul of great righteousness. That was Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a righteous soul. It was my great honor, when I was in the Senate and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to preside over her confirmation hearings and strongly support her ascension to the Supreme Court bench. Justice Ginsburg achieved a standing few justices have or ever will. She became a presence in the lives of so many Americans and a part of our culture.\\nJoe Biden: (06:00)\\nI agree with what others have said, that she did as much to advance the constitutional rights, opportunities, and justice for women as Justice Marshall did for African Americans. Yes, there was humor and mentions of the Notorious RBG and her impressive exercise routines, but there was so much more. She was, to use an overused word, a trailblazer, a role model, a source of hope and a powerful voice for justice. She was proof, proof that courage and conviction and moral clarity can change not only the law, it can change our culture. It can change the world. And I believe in the days and months and years ahead, excuse me, she will continue to inspire millions of Americans all across this country. And together we can, and we will, continue to be a voice for justice in her name.\\nJoe Biden: (07:05)\\nHer granddaughter said yesterday and said publicly that her dying words were, \\u201cMy most fervent wish is that I not be replaced until a new president is installed.\\u201d As a nation, we should heed her final call to us, not as a personal service to her, but as a service to the country, our country, at a crossroads. There\\u2019s so much at stake, the right to healthcare, clean air, clean water, the environment, equal pay for equal work, the rights of voters, immigrants, women, workers. And right now our country faces a choice, a choice about whether we will come back from the brink.\\nJoe Biden: (08:01)\\nThat\\u2019s what I would like to talk with you about for a few minutes today. Within an hour of news of her passing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said President Trump\\u2019s nominee to replace Justice Ginsburg will receive a vote in the Senate. Within an hour of her passing. The exact opposite of what he said when President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace Justice Scalia in 2016. At that time, Majority Leader McConnell made up a rule based on the fiction that I somehow believe there should be no nomination to the court in an election year. That\\u2019s ridiculous. The only rule I\\u2019ve ever followed relating to the Supreme Court nomination was the Constitution\\u2019s obligation for senators to provide their advice and their consent to a president\\u2019s judicial nominee.\\nJoe Biden: (09:02)\\nBut he created a new rule, the McConnell rule. Absolutely no hearing, no vote for a nominee in an election year, period, no caveats, and many Republican senators agreed with him, including then Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, including the current Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who at the time said, and I quote verbatim, here\\u2019s what he said. \\u201cI want you to use my words against me if there\\u2019s a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term. You can say, Lindsey Graham said, let\\u2019s let the next president, whoever it might be, make the nomination.\\u201d Continuing to quote, \\u201cAnd you could use my words against me, and you\\u2019d be absolutely right.\\u201d End of quote. That\\u2019s what Republicans said when Justice Scalia passed away about nine months before election day that year.\\nJoe Biden: (10:18)\\nNow, having lost Justice Ginsburg less than seven weeks before the election this year, after Americans have already begun to cast their vote. It\\u2019s estimated that up to 40% of Americans will have voted by October 1st, but at least 30%. Tens of millions. And you can\\u2019t unring the bell. Having made this their standard when it served their interests, they cannot just four years later change course when it doesn\\u2019t serve their ends. Look, I\\u2019m not being naive. I\\u2019m not speaking to President Trump, who will do whatever he wants. I\\u2019m not speaking to Mitch McConnell, who will do what he wants, and he does. I\\u2019m speaking to those Republicans out there, Senate Republicans, who know deep down what is right for the country and consistent with the Constitution, as I stand here in the Constitution Center, not just what\\u2019s best for their party.\\nJoe Biden: (11:30)\\nI\\u2019m speaking for millions of Americans out there who already have voted and continue to vote, and we\\u2019ll have many more voted by the time this process is finished. Millions of Americans who are voting because they know their healthcare hangs in the balance. In the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory, Donald Trump is before the Supreme Court, trying to strip healthcare coverage away from tens of millions of families. This took away the peace of mind of more than 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions. If he succeeds, insurers could once again discriminate or drop coverage completely for people living with preexisting conditions, like asthma, diabetes, cancer, and so many other problems.\\nJoe Biden: (12:28)\\nAnd perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be, it\\u2019s estimated that 200 million people have died probably by the time I finish this talk, the complications of COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, could become the next deniable preexisting condition for over six million Americans who\\u2019ve already contracted the disease.\\nJoe Biden: (13:09)\\nMillions of Americans are also voting because they don\\u2019t want nearly half a century of legal precedent to be overturned and lose the right to choose. Millions of Americans who are at risk of losing their right to vote. Millions of Dreamers who are at risk of being expelled from the only country they have ever known. Millions of workers. Union workers who are at risk of losing their right to collectively bargain. Millions of Americans who are demanding that their voices be heard, that equal justice be a guarantee for all, not just some. They know, we all know, what should happen now. The voters of this country should be heard. As I said, voting has already begun. By the time we get to the middle of October, there will be millions and millions and millions who have already voted. In just a few weeks, all votes in this nation will be heard. They\\u2019re the ones who the Constitution envisions should decide who has the power to make this appointment.\\nJoe Biden: (14:27)\\nThis appointment isn\\u2019t about the past. It\\u2019s about the future, and the people of this nation, and the people of this nation are choosing their future right now, as they vote. To jam this nomination through the Senate is just an exercise in raw political power, and I don\\u2019t believe that the people of this nation will stand for it. President Trump has already made it clear, this is about power, pure and simple power. Whether the voters should make it clear on this issue and so many others, the power in this nation resides with them, the American people, the voters, and even if President Trump wants to put forward a name now, the Senate should not act until after the American people select their next president, their next Congress, their next Senate. If Donald Trump wins the election, then the Senate should move on his selection and weigh the nominee he chooses fairly.\\nJoe Biden: (15:39)\\nBut if I win this election, President Trump\\u2019s nominee should be withdrawn, and as a new president I should be the one who nominates Justice Ginsburg\\u2019s successor, a nominee who should get a fair hearing in the Senate before a confirmation hearing, before a confirmation vote, I should say, after a confirmation hearing.\\nJoe Biden: (16:05)\\nWe\\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic. Like I said, as I speak, we\\u2019re probably passing 200,000 deaths lost to this virus. Tens of millions of Americans are unemployed. Healthcare in this country hangs in the balance before the court. And now, in a raw political move, this president and the Republican leader have decided to jam a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court through the United States Senate. That\\u2019s the last thing we need at this moment. As I said, voters have already begun casting their votes in the millions. And in just a few weeks, we\\u2019re going to know who the voters of this nation have chosen as the next president. The United States Constitution was designed to give voters one chance, one chance to have their voice heard in who serves on the court. And by the way, there\\u2019s no court session between now and the end of this election.\\nJoe Biden: (17:12)\\nThat moment is now for the voters to get a chance to be heard, and their voice should be heard. And I believe voters are going to make it clear. They\\u2019ll not stand for this abuse of power, this constitutional abuse. There\\u2019s no discussion about what happens if the Senate confirms on the eve of election or in a lame duck after Donald Trump loses. A successor to Justice Ginsburg, what happens? But that discussion assumes that we lose this effort to prevent the grave wrong that Trump and McConnell are pursuing here. I\\u2019m not going to assume failure at this point. I believe the voices of the American people should be heard and will be heard. This vote, this fight, this nomination will not be over until the Senate votes, if it does vote. Winning that vote, if it happens, is everything. Action and reaction, anger and more anger, sorrow and frustration at the way things are in this country now politically, that\\u2019s the cycle that Republican senators will continue to perpetuate if they go down this dangerous path that they put us on.\\nJoe Biden: (18:37)\\nWe need to deescalate, not escalate. That\\u2019s why I appeal to those few Senate Republicans, the handful who really will decide what happens. Please, follow your conscience. Don\\u2019t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created. Don\\u2019t go there. Uphold your constitutional duty, your conscience. Let the people speak. Cool the flames that have been engulfing our country. We can\\u2019t keep rewriting history, scrambling norms, ignoring our cherished system of checks and balances. That includes this whole business of releasing a list of potential nominees that I would put forward. They\\u2019re now saying, after Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, they said, \\u201cBiden should release his list.\\u201d It\\u2019s no wonder the Trump campaign asked that I release the list only after she passed away. It\\u2019s a game for them. It\\u2019s a play to [inaudible 00:19:44] up emotions and anger.\\nJoe Biden: (19:46)\\nThere\\u2019s a reason why no presidential candidate, other than Donald Trump, has ever done such a thing. First, putting a judge\\u2019s name on a list like that could influence that person\\u2019s decision making as a judge, and that would be wrong, or at least create the perception that it would have influence. Second, anyone put on a list like that under these circumstances will be subject to unrelenting political attacks. Because any nominee I would select would not get a hearing until 2021 at the earliest, she would endure those attacks for months on end, without being able to defend herself. Thirdly, and finally, perhaps most importantly, if I win, I\\u2019ll make my choice for the Supreme Court not based on a partisan election campaign, but on what prior presidents have done, Republican and Democrats, and I\\u2019ve served with many of them.\\nJoe Biden: (20:49)\\nOnly after consulting Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate and seeking their advice and asking for the consent, it says, \\u201cAdvice and consent of the Senate,\\u201d the president is the person who gets to name someone, propose. The Senate deposes. As everyone knows, I made it clear that my first choice for the Supreme Court will make history as the first African American woman justice. But I\\u2019ll consult with senators in both parties about that pick, as well as the legal and civil leaders in our country. In the end, the choice will be mine and mine alone, but I will consult. It will be the product of a process that restores our finest traditions, not the extension of one that\\u2019s torn this country apart the last years.\\nJoe Biden: (21:47)\\nSo let me conclude with this. As I\\u2019ve said in this campaign, we\\u2019re in the battle for the soul of this country. We face historic crises, once in a generation pandemic, a devastating economic recession, the rise of white supremacy that the FBI directors warned us against, unseen since the sixties, and a reckoning on race that\\u2019s long overdue, a challenging climate, a changing climate that is ravaging our nation and the world as we speak. Supreme Court decisions will touch every part of these crises, every part of our lives and our future. The last thing we need is to add a constitutional crisis that plunges us deeper into the abyss, deeper into the darkness.\\nJoe Biden: (22:51)\\nIf we go down this path, I predict it will cause irreversible damage. The infection this president has unleashed on our democracy can be fatal. Enough. Enough. Enough. We must come together as a nation. Democrats, Republicans, independents, liberals, conservatives, everybody. I\\u2019m not saying we have to agree on everything, but we have to reason our way through what ails us as citizens, voters, public service. That\\u2019s the guidebook called the Constitution. We have to act in good faith, in mutual goodwill, in the spirit of conciliation, not confrontation.\\nJoe Biden: (23:49)\\nThis nation will continue to be inspired by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but we should not only be inspired by her, we should be guided by her, by her willingness to listen to those with whom she disagreed, to respect other points of view. Famously, Justice Ginsburg got along well with some of the most conservative justices on the court. And she did it without compromising her principles, clouding her moral clarity, or losing her core principles. If she can do this, so can we. How we talk to one another matters, how we treat one another matters, respecting others matters. Justice Ginsburg proved it\\u2019s important to have a spine of steel, but also important to have an open hand, not a clenched fist, to those with whom we disagree.\\nJoe Biden: (24:54)\\nThis nation needs to come together. I\\u2019ve said it many times in this election. We are the United States of America. There\\u2019s nothing we cannot overcome. There\\u2019s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. Donald Trump seems to want to divide this nation between red states and blue states, between representing those states that vote for him and ignoring those who don\\u2019t. I do not. I cannot, I will not be that president. I\\u2019ll be a president for the whole country, for those who vote for me and those who vote against me. We need to rise in this moment for the sake of the country we love so dearly, indeed for its very soul. May God bless the United States of America. May God protect our troops. And may God bless Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

I had the great privilege of being a guest here. Its an appropriate place to make the speech Im about to make. I attended a mass earlier today and prayed for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her family. The nation lost a heroine, an icon. They also lost a mother, a grandmother, and a matriarch. We know how hard that is, to watch a piece of your soul absorb the cruelty and the pain of the dreadful disease of cancer. I spoke to her daughter and her granddaughter last night, expressing my whole family, I mean, my whole familys sorrow, particularly my grown granddaughters, one of whom was a student of Ruth Bader Ginsburgs daughter at Columbia. They made clear to me, daughter and granddaughter, that until the very end, Justice Ginsburg displayed the character and courage wed expect of her. They said she held their hands and gave them strength and purpose to carry on.Its been noted that she passed away on Rosh Hashanah. By tradition, a person who dies during the Jewish new year is considered a soul of great righteousness. That was Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a righteous soul. It was my great honor, when I was in the Senate and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to preside over her confirmation hearings and strongly support her ascension to the Supreme Court bench. Justice Ginsburg achieved a standing few justices have or ever will. She became a presence in the lives of so many Americans and a part of our culture.I agree with what others have said, that she did as much to advance the constitutional rights, opportunities, and justice for women as Justice Marshall did for African Americans. Yes, there was humor and mentions of the Notorious RBG and her impressive exercise routines, but there was so much more. She was, to use an overused word, a trailblazer, a role model, a source of hope and a powerful voice for justice. She was proof, proof that courage and conviction and moral clarity can change not only the law, it can change our culture. It can change the world. And I believe in the days and months and years ahead, excuse me, she will continue to inspire millions of Americans all across this country. And together we can, and we will, continue to be a voice for justice in her name.Her granddaughter said yesterday and said publicly that her dying words were, My most fervent wish is that I not be replaced until a new president is installed. As a nation, we should heed her final call to us, not as a personal service to her, but as a service to the country, our country, at a crossroads. Theres so much at stake, the right to healthcare, clean air, clean water, the environment, equal pay for equal work, the rights of voters, immigrants, women, workers. And right now our country faces a choice, a choice about whether we will come back from the brink.Thats what I would like to talk with you about for a few minutes today. Within an hour of news of her passing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said President Trumps nominee to replace Justice Ginsburg will receive a vote in the Senate. Within an hour of her passing. The exact opposite of what he said when President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace Justice Scalia in 2016.

I want you to use my words against me if theres a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term.

The fruits of the earth have been unusually abundant, commerce has flourished, the revenue has exceeded the most favorable anticipation, and peace and amity are preserved with foreign nations on conditions just and honorable to our country. For these inestimable blessings we can not but be grateful to that Providence which watches over the destiny of nations. As the term limited for the operation of the commercial convention with Great Britain will expire early in the month of July next, and it was deemed important that there should be no interval during which that portion of our commerce which was provided for by that convention should not be regulated, either by arrangement between the two Governments or by the authority of Congress, the minister of the United States at London was instructed early in the last summer to invite the attention of the British Government to the subject, with a view to that object. He was instructed to propose also that the negotiation which it was wished to open might extend to the general commerce of the two countries, and to every other interest and unsettled difference between them in the hope that an arrangement might be made on principles of reciprocal advantage which might comprehend and provide in a satisfactory manner for all these high concerns. I have the satisfaction to state that the proposal was received by the British Government in the spirit which prompted it, and that a negotiation has been opened at London embracing all these objects. On full consideration of the great extent and magnitude of the trust it was thought proper to commit it to not less than two of our distinguished citizens, and in consequence the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris has been associated with our envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at London, to both of whom corresponding instructions have been given, and they are now engaged in the discharge of its duties. It is proper to add that to prevent any inconvenience resulting from the delay incident to a negotiation on so many important subjects it was agreed before entering on it that the existing convention should be continued for a term not less than eight years. Our relations with Spain remain nearly in the state in which they were at the close of the last session. The convention of 1802, providing for the adjustment of a certain portion of the claims of our citizens for injuries sustained by spoliation, and so long suspended by the Spanish Government, has at length been ratified by it, but no arrangement has yet been made for the payment of another portion of like claims, not less extensive or well founded, or for other classes of claims, or for the settlement of boundaries. These subjects have again been brought under consideration in both countries, but no agreement has been entered into respecting them. In the mean time events have occurred which clearly prove the ill effect of the policy which that Government has so long pursued on the friendly relations of the two countries, which it is presumed is at least of as much importance to Spain as to the United States to maintain. A state of things has existed in the Floridas the tendency of which has been obvious to all who have paid the slightest attention to the progress of affairs in that quarter. Throughout the whole of those Provinces to which the Spanish title extends the Government of Spain has scarcely been felt. Its authority has been confined almost exclusively to the walls of Pensacola and St. Augustine, within which only small garrisons have been maintained. Adventurers from every country, fugitives from justice, and absconding slaves have found an asylum there. Several tribes of Indians, strong in the # of their warriors, remarkable for their ferocity, and whose settlements extend to our limits, inhabit those Provinces. These different hordes of people, connected together, disregarding on the one side the authority of Spain, and protected on the other by an imaginary line which separates Florida from the United States, have violated our laws prohibiting the introduction of slaves, have practiced various frauds on our revenue, and committed every kind of outrage on our peaceable citizens which their proximity to us enabled them to perpetrate. The invasion of Amelia Island last year by a small band of adventurers, not exceeding 150 in number, who wrested it from the inconsiderable Spanish force stationed there, and held it several months, during which a single feeble effort only was made to recover it, which failed, clearly proves how completely extinct the Spanish authority had become, as the conduct of those adventurers while in possession of the island as distinctly shows the pernicious purposes for which their combination had been formed. This country had, in fact, become the theater of every species of lawless adventure. With little population of its own, the Spanish authority almost extinct, and the colonial governments in a state of revolution, having no pretension to it, and sufficiently employed in their own concerns, it was in great measure derelict, and the object of cupidity to every adventurer. A system of buccaneering was rapidly organizing over it which menaced in its consequences the lawful commerce of every nation, and particularly the United States, while it presented a temptation to every people, on whose seduction its success principally depended. In regard to the United States, the pernicious effect of this unlawful combination was not confined to the ocean; the Indian tribes have constituted the effective force in Florida. With these tribes these adventurers had formed at an early period a connection with a view to avail themselves of that force to promote their own projects of accumulation and aggrandizement. It is to the interference of some of these adventurers, in misrepresenting the claims and titles of the Indians to land and in practicing on their savage propensities, that the Seminole war is principally to be traced. Men who thus connect themselves with savage communities and stimulate them to war, which is always attended on their part with acts of barbarity the most shocking, deserve to be viewed in a worse light than the savages. They would certainly have no claim to an immunity from the punishment which, according to the rules of warfare practiced by the savages, might justly be inflicted on the savages themselves. If the embarrassments of Spain prevented her from making an indemnity to our citizens for so long a time from her treasury for their losses by spoliation and otherwise, it was always in her power to have provided it by the cession of this territory. Of this her Government has been repeatedly apprised, and the cession was the more to have been anticipated as Spain must have known that in ceding it she would likewise relieve herself from the important obligation secured by the treaty of 1795 and all other compromitments respecting it. If the United States, from consideration of these embarrassments, declined pressing their claims in a spirit of hostility, the motive ought at least to have been duly appreciated by the Government of Spain. It is well known to her Government that other powers have made to the United States an indemnity for like losses sustained by their citizens at the same epoch. There is nevertheless a limit beyond which this spirit of amity and forbearance can in no instance be justified. If it was proper to rely on amicable negotiation for an indemnity for losses, it would not have been so to have permitted the inability of Spain to fulfill her engagements and to sustain her authority in the Floridas to be perverted by foreign adventurers and savages to purposes so destructive to the lives of our fellow citizens and the highest interests of the United States. The right of self defense never ceases. It is among the most sacred, and alike necessary to nations and to individuals, and whether the attack be made by Spain herself or by those who abuse her power, its obligation is not the less strong. The invaders of Amelia Island had assumed a popular and respected title under which they might approach and wound us. As their object was distinctly seen, and the duty imposed on the Executive by an existing law was profoundly felt, that mask was not permitted to protect them. It was thought incumbent on the United States to suppress the establishment, and it was accordingly done. The combination in Florida for the unlawful purposes stated, the acts perpetrated by that combination, and, above all, the incitement of the Indians to massacre our fellow citizens of every age and of both sexes, merited a like treatment and received it. In pursuing these savages to an imaginary line in the woods it would have been the height of folly to have suffered that line to protect them. Had that been done the war could never cease. Even if the territory had been exclusively that of Spain and her power complete over it, we had a right by the law of nations to follow the enemy on it and to subdue him there. But the territory belonged, in a certain sense at least, to the savage enemy who inhabited it; the power of Spain had ceased to exist over it, and protection was sought under her title by those who had committed on our citizens hostilities which she was bound by treaty to have prevented, but had not the power to prevent. To have stopped at that line would have given new encouragement to these savages and new vigor to the whole combination existing there in the prosecution of all its pernicious purposes. In suppressing the establishment at Amelia Island no unfriendliness was manifested toward Spain, because the post was taken from a force which had wrested it from her. The measure, it is true, was not adopted in concert with the Spanish Government or those in authority under it, because in transactions connected with the war in which Spain and the colonies are engaged it was thought proper in doing justice to the United States to maintain a strict impartiality toward both the belligerent parties without consulting or acting in concert with either. It gives me pleasure to state that the Governments of Buenos Ayres and Venezuela, whose names were assumed, have explicitly disclaimed all participation in those measures, and even the knowledge of them until communicated by this Government, and have also expressed their satisfaction that a course of proceedings had been suppressed which if justly imputable to them would dishonor their cause. In authorizing Major-General Jackson to enter Florida in pursuit of the Seminoles care was taken not to encroach on the rights of Spain. I regret to have to add that in executing this order facts were disclosed respecting the conduct of the officers of Spain in authority there in encouraging the war, furnishing munitions of war and other supplies to carry it on, and in other acts not less marked which evinced their participation in the hostile purposes of that combination and justified the confidence with which it inspired the savages that by those officers they would be protected. A conduct so incompatible with the friendly relations existing between the two countries, particularly with the positive obligations of the 5th article of the treaty of 1795, by which Spain was bound to restrain, even by force, those savages from acts of hostility against the United States, could not fail to excite surprise. The commanding general was convinced that he should fail in his object, that he should in effect accomplish nothing, if he did not deprive those savages of the resource on which they had calculated and of the protection on which they had relied in making the war. As all the documents relating to this occurrence will be laid before Congress, it is not necessary to enter into further detail respecting it. Although the reasons which induced Major-General Jackson to take these posts were duly appreciated, there was nevertheless no hesitation in deciding on the course which it became the Government to pursue. As there was reason to believe that the commanders of these posts had violated their instructions, there was no disposition to impute to their Government a conduct so unprovoked and hostile. An order was in consequence issued to the general in command there to deliver the posts - Pensacola unconditionally to any person duly authorized to receive it, and St. Marks, which is in the heart of the Indian country, on the arrival of a competent force to defend it against those savages and their associates. In entering Florida to suppress this combination no idea was entertained of hostility to Spain, and however justifiable the commanding general was, in consequence of the misconduct of the Spanish officers, in entering St. Marks and Pensacola to terminate it by proving to the savages and their associates that they should not be protected even there, yet the amicable relations existing between the United States and Spain could not be altered by that act alone. By ordering the restitution of the posts those relations were preserved. To a change of them the power of the Executive is deemed incompetent; it is vested in Congress only. By this measure, so promptly taken, due respect was shown to the Government of Spain. The misconduct of her officers has not been imputed to her. She was enabled to review with candor her relations with the United States and her own situation, particularly in respect to the territory in question, with the dangers inseparable from it, and regarding the losses we have sustained for which indemnity has been so long withheld, and the injuries we have suffered through that territory, and her means of redress, she was likewise enabled to take with honor the course best calculated to do justice to the United States and to promote her own welfare. Copies of the instructions to the commanding general, of his correspondence with the Secretary of War, explaining his motives and justifying his conduct, with a copy of the proceedings of the courts martial in the trial of Arbuthnot and Ambristie, and of the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the minister plenipotentiary of Spain near this Government, and of the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Madrid with the Government of Spain, will be laid before Congress. The civil war which has so long prevailed between Spain and the Provinces in South America still continues, without any prospect of its speedy termination. The information respecting the condition of those countries which has been collected by the commissioners recently returned from thence will be laid before Congress in copies of their reports, with such other information as has been received from other agents of the United States. It appears from these communications that the Government at Buenos Ayres declared itself independent in 1816 July, having previously exercised the power of an independent Government, though in the name of the King of Spain, from the year 1810; that the Banda Oriental, Entre Rios, and Paraguay, with the city of Santa Fee, all of which are also independent, are unconnected with the present Government of Buenos Ayres; that Chili has declared itself independent and is closely connected with Buenos Ayres; that Venezuela has also declared itself independent, and now maintains the conflict with various success; and that the remaining parts of South America, except Monte Video and such other portions of the eastern bank of the La Plata as are held by Portugal, are still in the possession of Spain or in a certain degree under her influence. By a circular note addressed by the ministers of Spain to the allied powers, with whom they are respectively accredited, it appears that the allies have undertaken to mediate between Spain and the South American Provinces, and that the manner and extent of their interposition would be settled by a congress which was to have met at Aix-la-Chapelle in September last. From the general policy and course of proceeding observed by the allied powers in regard to this contest it is inferred that they will confine their interposition to the expression of their sentiments, abstaining from the application of force. I state this impression that force will not be applied with the greater satisfaction because it is a course more consistent with justice and likewise authorizes a hope that the calamities of the war will be confined to the parties only, and will be of shorter duration. From the view taken of this subject, founded on all the information that we have been able to obtain, there is good cause to be satisfied with the course heretofore pursued by the United States in regard to this contest, and to conclude that it is proper to adhere to it, especially in the present state of affairs. I have great satisfaction in stating that our relations with France, Russia, and other powers continue on the most friendly basis. In our domestic concerns we have ample cause of satisfaction. The receipts into the Treasury during the three first quarters of the year have exceeded $ 193,000 ) could After satisfying all the demands which have been made under existing appropriations, including the final extinction of the old 6 % stock and the redemption of a moiety of the Louisiana debt, it is estimated that there will remain in the Treasury on the 1st day of January next more than $ Kal\\u00e9o It is ascertained that the gross revenue which has accrued from the customs during the same period amounts to $ 21 M, and that the revenue of the whole year may be estimated at not less than $ 74,480,201.05. The sale of the public lands during the year has also greatly exceeded, both in quantity and price, that of any former year, and there is just reason to expect a progressive improvement in that source of revenue. It is gratifying to know that although the annual expenditure has been increased by the act of the last session of Congress providing for Revolutionary pensions to an amount about equal to the proceeds of the internal duties which were then repealed, the revenue for the ensuing year will be proportionally augmented, and that whilst the public expenditure will probably remain stationary, each successive year will add to the national resources by the ordinary increase of our population and by the gradual development of our latent sources of national prosperity. The strict execution of the revenue laws, resulting principally from the salutary provisions of the act of the 20th of April last amending the several collection laws, has, it is presumed, secured to domestic manufactures all the relief that can be derived from the duties which have been imposed upon foreign merchandise for their protection. Under the influence of this relief several branches of this important national interest have assumed greater activity, and although it is hoped that others will gradually revive and ultimately triumph over every obstacle, yet the expediency of granting further protection is submitted to your consideration. The measures of defense authorized by existing laws have been pursued with the zeal and activity due to so important an object, and with all the dispatch practicable in so extensive and great an undertaking. The survey of our maritime and inland frontiers has been continued, and at the points where it was decided to erect fortifications the work has been commenced, and in some instances considerable progress has been made. In compliance with resolutions of the last session, the Board of Commissioners were directed to examine in a particular manner the parts of the coast therein designated and to report their opinion of the most suitable sites for two naval depots. This work is in a train of execution. The opinion of the Board on this subject, with a plan of all the works necessary to a general system of defense so far as it has been formed, will be laid before Congress in a report from the proper department as soon as it can be prepared. In conformity with the appropriations of the last session, treaties have been formed with the Quapaw tribe of Indians, inhabiting the country on the Arkansaw, and the Great and Little Osages north of the White River; with the tribes in the State of Indiana; with the several tribes within the State of Ohio and the Michigan Territory, and with the Chickasaws, by which very extensive cessions of territory have been made to the United States. Negotiations are now depending with the tribes in the Illinois Territory and with the Choctaws, by which it is expected that other extensive cessions will be made. I take great interest in stating that the cessions already made, which are considered so important to the United States, have been obtained on conditions very satisfactory to the Indians. With a view to the security of our inland frontiers, it has been thought expedient to establish strong posts at the mouth of Yellow Stone River and at the Mandan village on the Missouri, and at the mouth of St. Peters on the Mississippi, at no great distance from our northern boundaries. It can hardly be presumed while such posts are maintained in the rear of the Indian tribes that they will venture to attack our peaceable inhabitants. A strong hope is entertained that this measure will likewise be productive of much good to the tribes themselves, especially in promoting the great object of their civilization. Experience has clearly demonstrated that independent savage communities can not long exist within the limits of a civilized population. The progress of the latter has almost invariably terminated in the extinction of the former, especially of the tribes belonging to our portion of this hemisphere, among whom loftiness of sentiment and gallantry in action have been conspicuous. To civilize them, and even to prevent their extinction, it seems to be indispensable that their independence as communities should cease, and that the control of the United States over them should be complete and undisputed. The hunter state will then be more easily abandoned, and recourse will be had to the acquisition and culture of land and to other pursuits tending to dissolve the ties which connect them together as a savage community and to give a new character to every individual. I present this subject to the consideration of Congress on the presumption that it may be found expedient and practicable to adopt some benevolent provisions, having these objects in view, relative to the tribes within our settlements. It has been necessary during the present year to maintain, a strong naval force in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico, and to send some public ships along the southern coast and to the Pacific Ocean. By these means amicable relations with the Barbary Powers have been preserved, our commerce has been protected, and our rights respected. The augmentation of our Navy is advancing with a steady progress toward the limit contemplated by law. I communicate with great satisfaction the accession of another State ( Illinois ) to our Union, because I perceive from the proof afforded by the additions already made the regular progress and sure consummation of a policy of which history affords no example, and of which the good effect can not be too highly estimated. By extending our Government on the principles of our Constitution over the vast territory within our limits, on the Lakes and the Mississippi and its numerous streams, new life and vigor are infused into every part of our system. By increasing the number of the States the confidence of the State governments in their own security is increased and their jealousy of the National Government proportionally diminished. The impracticability of one consolidated Government for this great and growing nation will be more apparent and will be universally admitted. Incapable of exercising local authority except for general purposes, the General Government will no longer be dreaded. In those cases of a local nature and for all the great purposes for which it was instituted its authority will be cherished. Each Government will acquire new force and a greater freedom of action within its proper sphere. Other inestimable advantages will follow. Our produce will be augmented to an incalculable amount in articles of the greatest value for domestic use and foreign commerce. Our navigation will in like degree be increased, and as the shipping of the Atlantic States will be employed in the transportation of the vast produce of the Western country, even those parts of the United States which are most remote from each other will be further bound together by the strongest ties which mutual interest can create. The situation of this District, it is thought, requires the attention of Congress. By the Constitution the power of legislation is exclusively vested in the Congress of the United States. In the exercise of this power, in which the people have no participation, Congress legislate in all cases directly on the local concerns of the District. As this is a departure, for a special purpose, from the general principles of our system, it may merit consideration whether an arrangement better adapted to the principles of our Government and to the particular interests of the people may not be devised which will neither infringe the Constitution nor affect the object which the provision in question was intended to secure. The growing population, already considerable, and the increasing business of the District, which it is believed already interferes with the deliberations of Congress on great national concerns, furnish additional motives for recommending this subject to your consideration. When we view the great blessings with which our country has been favored, those which we now enjoy, and the means which we possess of handing them down unimpaired to our latest posterity, our attention is irresistibly drawn to the source from whence they flow. Let us, then, unite in offering our most grateful acknowledgments for these blessings to the Divine Author of All Good\",\n          \"To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: It is provided by the Constitution that the President shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the Union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. In reviewing the events of the year which has elapsed since the commencement of your sessions, I first call your attention to the gratifying condition of our foreign affairs. Our intercourse with other powers has continued to be of the most friendly character. Such slight differences as have arisen during the year have been already settled or are likely to reach an early adjustment. The arrest of citizens of the United States in Ireland under recent laws which owe their origin to the disturbed condition of that country has led to a somewhat extended correspondence with the Government of Great Britain. A disposition to respect our rights has been practically manifested by the release of the arrested parties. The claim of this nation in regard to the supervision and control of any interoceanic canal across the American Isthmus has continued to be the subject of conference. It is likely that time will be more powerful than discussion in removing the divergence between the two nations whose friendship is so closely cemented by the intimacy of their relations and the community of their interests. Our long established friendliness with Russia has remained unshaken. It has prompted me to proffer the earnest counsels of this Government that measures be adopted for suppressing the proscription which the Hebrew race in that country has lately suffered. It has not transpired that any American citizen has been subjected to arrest or injury, but our courteous remonstrance has nevertheless been courteously received. There is reason to believe that the time is not far distant when Russia will be able to secure toleration to all faiths within her borders. At an international convention held at Paris in 1880, and attended by representatives of the United States, an agreement was reached in respect to the protection of trade marks, patented articles, and the rights of manufacturing firms and corporations. The formulating into treaties of the recommendations thus adopted is receiving the attention which it merits. The protection of submarine cables is a subject now under consideration by an international conference at Paris. Believing that it is clearly the true policy of this Government to favor the neutralization of this means of intercourse, I requested our minister to France to attend the convention as a delegate. I also designated two of our eminent scientists to attend as our representatives at the meeting of an international committee at Paris for considering the adoption of a common unit to measure electric force. In view of the frequent occurrence of conferences for the consideration of important matters of common interest to civilized nations, I respectfully suggest that the Executive be invested by Congress with discretionary powers to send delegates to such conventions, and that provision be made to defray the expenses incident thereto. The difference between the United States and Spain as to the effect of a judgment and certificate of naturalization has not yet been adjusted, but it is hoped and believed that negotiations now in progress will result in the establishment of the position which seems to this Government so reasonable and just. I have already called the attention of Congress to the fact that in the ports of Spain and its colonies onerous fines have lately been imposed upon vessels of the United States for trivial technical offenses against local regulations. Efforts for the abatement of these exactions have thus far proved unsuccessful. I regret to inform you also that the fees demanded by Spanish consuls in American ports are in some cases so large, when compared with the value of the cargo, as to amount in effect to a considerable export duty, and that our remonstrances in this regard have not as yet received the attention which they seem to deserve. The German Government has invited the United States to participate in an international exhibition of domestic cattle to be held at Hamburg in July, 1883. If this country is to be represented, it is important that in the early days of this session Congress should make a suitable appropriation for that purpose. The death of Mr. Marsh, our late minister to Italy, has evoked from that Government expressions of profound respect for his exalted character and for his honorable career in the diplomatic service of his country. The Italian Government has raised a question as to the propriety of recognizing in his dual capacity the representative of this country recently accredited both as secretary of legation and as support at Rome. He has been received as secretary, but his exequatur as support has thus far been withheld. The extradition convention with Belgium, which has been in operation since 1874, has been lately supplanted by another. The Senate has signified its approval, and ratifications have been duly exchanged between the contracting countries. To the list of extraditable crimes has been added that of the assassination or attempted assassination of the chief of the State. Negotiations have been opened with Switzerland looking to a settlement by treaty of the question whether its citizens can renounce their allegiance and become citizens of the United States without obtaining the consent of the Swiss Government. I am glad to inform you that the immigration of paupers and criminals from certain of the Cantons of Switzerland has substantially ceased and is no longer sanctioned by the authorities. The consideration of this subject prompts the suggestion that the act of August 3, 1882, which has for its object the return of foreign convicts to their own country, should be so modified as not to be open to the interpretation that it affects the extradition of criminals on preferred charges of crime. The Ottoman Porte has not yet assented to the interpretation which this Government has put upon the treaty of 1830 relative to its jurisdictional rights in Turkey. It may well be, however, that this difference will be adjusted by a general revision of the system of jurisdiction of the United States in the countries of the East, a subject to which your attention has been already called by the Secretary of State. In the interest of justice toward China and Japan, I trust that the question of the return of the indemnity fund to the Governments of those countries will reach at the present session the satisfactory solution which I have already recommended, and which has recently been foreshadowed by Congressional discussion. The treaty lately concluded with Korea awaits the action of the Senate. During the late disturbance in Egypt the timely presence of American vessels served as a protection to the persons and property of many of our own citizens and of citizens of other countries, whose governments have expressed their thanks for this assistance. The recent legislation restricting immigration of laborers from China has given rise to the question whether Chinese proceeding to or from another country may lawfully pass through our own. Construing the act of May 6, 1882, in connection with the treaty of November 7, 1880, the restriction would seem to be limited to Chinese immigrants coming to the United States as laborers, and would not forbid a mere transit across our territory. I ask the attention of Congress to the subject, for such action, if any, as may be deemed advisable. This Government has recently had occasion to manifest its interest in the Republic of Liberia by seeking to aid the amicable settlement of the boundary dispute now pending between that Republic and the British possession of Sierra Leone. The reciprocity treaty with Hawaii will become terminable after September 9, 1883, on twelve months ' notice by either party. While certain provisions of that compact may have proved onerous, its existence has fostered commercial relations which it is important to preserve. I suggest, therefore, that early consideration be given to such modifications of the treaty as seem to be demanded by the interests of our people. In view of our increasing trade with both Hayti and Santo Domingo, I advise that provision be made for diplomatic intercourse with the latter by enlarging the scope of the mission at Port au Prince. I regret that certain claims of American citizens against the Government of Hayti have thus far been urged unavailingly. A recent agreement with Mexico provides for the crossing of the frontier by the armed forces of either country in pursuit of hostile Indians. In my message of last year I called attention to the prevalent lawlessness upon the borders and to the necessity of legislation for its suppression. I again invite the attention of Congress to the subject. A partial relief from these mischiefs has been sought in a convention, which now awaits the approval of the Senate, as does also another touching the establishment of the international boundary between the United States and Mexico. If the latter is ratified, the action of Congress will be required for establishing suitable commissions of survey. The boundary dispute between Mexico and Guatemala, which led this Government to proffer its friendly counsels to both parties, has been amicably settled. No change has occurred in our relations with Venezuela. I again invoke your action in the matter of the pending awards against that Republic, to which reference was made by a special message from the Executive at your last session. An invitation has been received from the Government of Venezuela to send representatives in July, 1883, to Caracas for participating in the centennial celebration of the birth of Bolivar, the founder of South American independence. In connection with this event it is designed to commence the erection at Caracas of a statue of Washington and to conduct an industrial exhibition which will be open to American products. I recommend that the United States be represented and that suitable provision be made therefor. The elevation of the grade of our mission in Central America to the plenipotentiary rank, which was authorized by Congress at its late session, has been since effected. The war between Peru and Bolivia on the one side and Chile on the other began more than three years ago. On the occupation by Chile in 1880 of all the littoral territory of Bolivia, negotiations for peace were conducted under the direction of the United States. The allies refused to concede any territory, but Chile has since become master of the whole coast of both countries and of the capital of Peru. A year since, as you have already been advised by correspondence transmitted to you in January last, this Government sent a special mission to the belligerent powers to express the hope that Chile would be disposed to accept a money indemnity for the expenses of the war and to relinquish her demand for a portion of the territory of her antagonist. This recommendation, which Chile declined to follow, this Government did not assume to enforce; nor can it be enforced without resort to measures which would be in keeping neither with the temper of our people nor with the spirit of our institutions. The power of Peru no longer extends over its whole territory, and in the event of our interference to dictate peace would need to be supplemented by the armies and navies of the United States. Such interference would almost inevitably lead to the establishment of a protectorate- a result utterly at odds with our past policy, injurious to our present interests, and full of embarrassments for the future. For effecting the termination of hostilities upon terms at once just to the victorious nation and generous to its adversaries, this Government has spared no efforts save such as might involve the complications which I have indicated. It is greatly to be deplored that Chile seems resolved to exact such rigorous conditions of peace and indisposed to submit to arbitration the terms of an amicable settlement. No peace is likely to be lasting that is not sufficiently equitable and just to command the approval of other nations. About a year since invitations were extended to the nations of this continent to send representatives to a peace congress to assemble at Washington in November, 1882. The time of meeting was fixed at a period then remote, in the hope, as the invitation itself declared, that in the meantime the disturbances between the South American Republics would be adjusted. As that expectation seemed unlikely to be realized, I asked in April last for an expression of opinion from the two Houses of Congress as to the advisability of holding the proposed convention at the time appointed. This action was prompted in part by doubts which mature reflection had suggested whether the diplomatic usage and traditions of the Government did not make it fitting that the Executive should consult the representatives of the people before pursuing a line of policy somewhat novel in its character and far reaching in its possible consequences. In view of the fact that no action was taken by Congress in the premises and that no provision had been made for necessary expenses, I subsequently decided to postpone the convocation, and so notified the several Governments which had been invited to attend. I am unwilling to dismiss this subject without assuring you of my support of any measures the wisdom of Congress may devise for the promotion of peace on this continent and throughout the world, and I trust that the time is nigh when, with the universal assent of civilized peoples, all international differences shall be determined without resort to arms by the benignant processes of arbitration. Changes have occurred in the diplomatic representation of several foreign powers during the past year. New ministers from the Argentine Republic, Austria-Hungary, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Russia have presented their credentials. The missions of Denmark and Venezuela at this capital have been raised in grade. Switzerland has created a plenipotentiary mission to this Government, and an embassy from Madagascar and a minister from Siam will shortly arrive. Our diplomatic intercourse has been enlarged by the establishment of relations with the new Kingdom of Servia, by the creation of a mission to Siam, and by the restoration of the mission to Greece. The Shah of Persia has expressed his gratification that a charge ' d'affaires will shortly be sent to that country, where the rights of our citizens have been hitherto courteously guarded by the representatives of Great Britain. I renew my recommendation of such legislation as will place the United States in harmony with other maritime powers with respect to the international rules for the prevention of collisions at sea. In conformity with your joint resolution of the 3d of August last, I have directed the Secretary of State to address foreign governments in respect to a proposed conference for considering the subject of the universal adoption of a common prime meridian to be used in the reckoning of longitude and in the regulation of time throughout the civilized world. Their replies will in due time be laid before you. An agreement was reached at Paris in 1875 between the principal powers for the interchange of official publications through the medium of their respective foreign departments. The admirable system which has been built up by the enterprise of the Smithsonian Institution affords a practical basis for our cooperation in this scheme, and an arrangement has been effected by which that institution will perform the ' necessary labor, under the direction of the Department of State. A reasonable compensation therefor should be provided by law. A clause in the act making appropriations for the diplomatic and consular service contemplates the reorganization of both branches of such service on a salaried basis, leaving fees to inure to the benefit of the Treasury. I cordially favor such a project, as likely to correct abuses in the present system. The Secretary of State will present to you at an early day a plan for such reorganization. A full and interesting exhibit of the operations of the Treasury Department is afforded by the report of the Secretary. It appears that the ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1882, were as follows: From customs $ 220,410,730.25 From internal revenue 146,497,595.45 From sales of public lands 4,753,140.37 From tax on circulation and deposits of national banks 8,956,794.45 From repayment of interest by Pacific Railway companies 840,554.37 From sinking fund for Pacific Railway companies 796,271.42 From customs fees, fines, penalties, etc 1,343,348.00 From fees -consular, letters patent, and lands 2,638,990.97 From proceeds of sales of Government property 314,959.85 From profits on coinage, bullion deposits, and assays 4,116,693.73 From Indian trust funds 5,705,243.22 From deposits by individuals for surveying public lands 2,052,306.36 From revenues of the District of Columbia 1,715,176.41 From miscellaneous sources 3,383,445.43 Total ordinary receipts Builders, 7 ordinary expenditures for the same period were For civil expenses $ 18,042,386.42 For foreign intercourse 1,307,583.19 For Indians 9,736,747.40 For pensions 61,345,193.95 For the military establishment, including river and harbor improvements, and arsenals 43,570,494.19 For the naval establishment, including vessels, machinery, andimprovements at navy-yards 15,032,046.26 For miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings, light-houses, and collecting the revenue 34,539,237.50 For expenditures on account of the District of Columbia 3,330,543.87 For interest on the public debt 71,077,206.79 Total ordinary expenditures Harriman, 1 a surplus revenue of $ 145,543,810.71, which, with an amount drawn from the cash balance in the Treasury of $ 20,737,694.84, making $ 166,281,505.55, was applied to the redemption Of bonds for the sinking fund $ 60,079,150.00 Of fractional currency for the sinking fund 58,705.55 Of loan of July and August, 1861 62,572,050.00 Of loan of March, 1863 4,472,900.00 Of funded loan of 1881 37,194,450.00 Of loan of 1858 303,000.00 Of loan of February, 1861 1,000.00 Of five-twenties of 1862 2,100.00 Of five-twenties of 1864 7,400.00 Of five-twenties of 1865 6,500.00 Of ten-forties of 1864 254,550.00 Of consols of 1865 86,450.00 Of consols of 1867 408,250.00 Of consols of 1868 141,400.00 Of Oregon War debt 675,250.00 Of old demand, compound interest, and other notes 18,350.00 1913 OUR foreign commerce of the United States during the last fiscal year, including imports and exports of merchandise and specie, was as follows: Exports: Merchandise $ 750,542,257 Specie 49,417,479 Total 799,959,73Guaid\\u00f3mports: Merchandise 724,639,574 Specie 42,472,390 Total committees. \\u201cI of exports over imports of merchandise Guant\\u00e1namo excess is less than it has been before for any of the previous six years, as appears by the following table: Year Ended June 30 Excess of exportsover imports ofmerchandise 1876 $ 79,643,481 1877 151,152,094 1878 257,814,234 1879 264,661,666 1880 167,683,912 1881 259,712,718 1882 Government.\\u201d I the year there have been organized 171 national banks, and of those institutions there are now in operation 2,269, a larger number than ever before. The value of their notes in active circulation on July 1, 1882, was $ 324,656,458. I commend to your attention the Secretary's views in respect to the likelihood of a serious contraction of this circulation, and to the modes by which that result may, in his judgment, be averted. In respect to the coinage of silver dollars and the retirement of silver certificates, I have seen nothing to alter but much to confirm the sentiments to which I gave expression last year. A comparison between the respective amounts of silver-dollar circulation on November 1, 1881, and on November 1, 1882, shows a slight increase of a million and a half of dollars; but during the interval there had been in the whole number coined an increase of twenty-six millions. Of the one hundred and twenty-eight millions thus far minted, little more than thirty five millions are in circulation. The mass of accumulated coin has grown so great that the vault room at present available for storage is scarcely sufficient to contain it. It is not apparent why it is desirable to continue this coinage, now so enormously in excess of the public demand. As to the silver certificates, in addition to the grounds which seemed last year to justify their retirement may be mentioned the effect which is likely to ensue from the supply of gold certificates for whose issuance Congress recently made provision, and which are now in active circulation. You can not fail to note with interest the discussion by the Secretary as to the necessity of providing by legislation some mode of freeing the Treasury of an excess of assets in the event that Congress fails to reach an early agreement for the reduction of taxation. I heartily approve the Secretary's recommendation of immediate and extensive reductions in the annual revenues of the Government. It will be remembered that I urged upon the attention of Congress at its last session the importance of relieving the industry and enterprise of the country from the pressure of unnecessary taxation. It is one of the tritest maxims of political economy that all taxes are burdensome, however wisely and prudently imposed; and though there have always been among our people wide differences of sentiment as to the best methods of raising the national revenues, and, indeed, as to the principles upon which taxation should be based, there has been substantial accord in the doctrine that only such taxes ought to be levied as are necessary for a wise and economical administration of the Government. Of late the public revenues have far exceeded that limit, and unless checked by. appropriate legislation such excess will continue to increase from year to year. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1881, the surplus revenue amounted to $ 100,000,000; for the fiscal year ended on the 30th of June last the surplus was more than one hundred and forty-five millions. The report of the Secretary shows what disposition has been made of these moneys. They have not only answered the requirements of the sinking fund, but have afforded a large balance applicable to other reductions of the public debt. But I renew the expression of my conviction that such rapid extinguishment of the national indebtedness as is now taking place is by no means a cause for congratulation; it is a cause rather for serious apprehension. If it continues, it must speedily be followed by one of the evil results so clearly set forth in the report of the Secretary. Either the surplus must lie idle in the Treasury or the Government will be forced to buy at market rates its bonds not then redeemable, and which under such circumstances can not fail to command an enormous premium, or the swollen revenues will be devoted to extravagant expenditure, which, as experience has taught, is ever the bane of an overflowing treasury. It was made apparent in the course of the animated discussions which this question aroused at the last session of Congress that the policy of diminishing the revenue by reducing taxation commanded the general approval of the members of both Houses. I regret that because of conflicting views as to the best methods by which that policy should be made operative none of its benefits have as yet been reaped. In fulfillment of what I deem my constitutional duty, but with little hope that I can make valuable contribution to this vexed question, I shall proceed to intimate briefly my own views in relation to it. Upon the showing of our financial condition at the close of the last fiscal year, I felt justified in recommending to Congress the abolition of all internal revenue taxes except those upon tobacco in its various forms and upon distilled spirits and fermented liquors, and except also the special tax upon the manufacturers of and dealers in such articles. I venture now to suggest that unless it shall be ascertained that the probable expenditures of the Government for the coming year have been underestimated all internal taxes save those which relate to distilled spirits can be prudently abrogated. Such a course, if accompanied by a simplification of the machinery of collection, which would then be easy of accomplishment, might reasonably be expected to result in diminishing the cost of such collection by at least $ 2,500,000 and in the retirement from office of from 1,500 to 2,000 persons. The system of excise duties has never commended itself to the favor of the American people, and has never been resorted to except for supplying deficiencies in the Treasury when, by reason of special exigencies, the duties on imports have proved inadequate for the needs of the Government. The sentiment of the country doubtless demands that the present excise tax shall be abolished as soon as such a course can be safely pursued. It seems to me, however, that, for various reasons, so sweeping a measure as the total abolition of internal taxes would for the present be an unwise step. Two of these reasons are deserving of special mention: First. It is by no means clear that even if the existing system of duties on imports is continued without modification those duties alone will yield sufficient revenue for all the needs of the Government. It is estimated that $ 100,000,000 will be required for pensions during the coming year, and it may well be doubted whether the maximum annual demand for that object has yet been reached. Uncertainty upon this question would alone justify, in my judgment, the retention for the present of that portion of the system of internal revenue which is least objectionable to the people. Second. A total abolition of excise taxes would almost inevitably prove a serious if not an insurmountable obstacle to a thorough revision of the tariff and to any considerable reduction in import duties. The present tariff system is in many respects unjust. It makes unequal distributions both of its burdens and its benefits. This fact was practically recognized by a majority of each House of Congress in the passage of the act creating the Tariff Commission. The report of that commission will be placed before you at the beginning of this session, and will, I trust, afford you such information as to the condition and prospects of the various commercial, agricultural, manufacturing, mining, and other interests of the country and contain such suggestions for statutory revision as will practically aid your action upon this important subject. The revenue from customs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879, amounted to $ 137,000,000. It has in the three succeeding years reached, first, $ 186,000,000, then $ 198,000,000, and finally, as has been already stated, $ 220,000,000. The income from this source for the fiscal year which will end on June 30, 1883, will doubtless be considerably in excess of the sum last mentioned. If the tax on domestic spirits is to be retained, it is plain, therefore, that large reductions from the customs revenue are entirely feasible. While recommending this reduction, I am far from advising the abandonment of the policy of so discriminating in the adjustment of details as to afford aid and protection to domestic labor. But the present system should be so revised as to equalize the public burden among all classes and occupations and bring it into closer harmony with the present needs of industry. Without entering into minute detail, which under present circumstances is quite unnecessary, I recommend an enlargement of the free list so as to include within it the numerous articles which yield inconsiderable revenue, a simplification of the complex and inconsistent schedule of duties upon certain manufactures, particularly those of cotton, iron, and steel, and a substantial reduction of the duties upon those articles and. upon sugar, molasses, silk, wool, and woolen goods. If a general revision of the tariff shall be found to be impracticable at this session, I express the hope that at least some of the more conspicuous inequalities of the present law may be corrected before your final adjournment. One of them is specially referred to by the Secretary. In view of a recent decision of the Supreme Court, the necessity of amending the law by which the Dutch standard of color is adopted as the test of the saccharine strength of sugars is too obvious to require comment. From the report of the Secretary of War it appears that the only outbreaks of Indians during the past year occurred in Arizona and in the southwestern part of New Mexico. They were promptly quelled, and the quiet which has prevailed in all other parts of the country has permitted such an addition to be made to the military force in the region endangered by the Apaches that there is little reason to apprehend trouble in the future. Those parts of the Secretary's report which relate to our seacoast defenses and their armament suggest the gravest reflections. Our existing fortifications are notoriously inadequate to the defense of the great harbors and cities for whose protection they were built. The question of providing an armament suited to our present necessities has been the subject of consideration by a board, whose report was transmitted to Congress at the last session. Pending the consideration of that report, the War Department has taken no steps for the manufacture or conversion of any heavy cannon, but the Secretary expresses the hope that authority and means to begin that important work will be soon provided. I invite the attention of Congress to the propriety of making more adequate provision for arming and equipping the militia than is afforded by the act of 1808, which is still upon the statute book. The matter has already been the subject of discussion in the Senate, and a bill which seeks to supply the deficiencies of existing laws is now upon its calendar. The Secretary of War calls attention to an embarrassment growing out of the recent act of Congress making the retirement of officers of the Army compulsory at the age of 64. The act of 1878 is still in force, which limits to 400 the number of those who can be retired for disability or upon their own application. The two acts, when construed together, seem to forbid the relieving, even for absolute incapacity, of officers who do not fall within the purview of the later statute, save at such times as there chance to be less than 40 names on the retired list. There are now 420. It is not likely that Congress intended this result, and I concur with the Secretary that the law ought to be amended. The grounds that impelled me to withhold my signature from the bill entitled \\u201cAn act making appropriations for the construction, repair, and preservation of certain works on rivers and harbors,\\u201d which became a law near the close of your last session, prompt me to express the hope that no similar measure will be deemed necessary during the present session of Congress. Indeed, such a measure would now be open to a serious objection in addition to that which was lately urged upon your attention. I am informed by the Secretary of War that the greater portion of the sum appropriated for the various items specified in that act remains unexpended. Of the new works which it authorized, expenses have been incurred upon two only, for which the total appropriation was $ 210,000. The present available balance is disclosed by the following table: Amount of appropriation by act of August 2, 1882 $ 18,738,875 Amount of appropriation by act of June 19, 1882 10,000 Amount of appropriation for payments to J. B. Eads 304,000 Unexpended balance of former appropriations 4,738,263 23,791,130 Less amount drawn from Treasury between July 1, 1882, andNovember 30, 1882 6,056,194 403,525,250.28 The is apparent by this exhibit that so far as concerns most of the items to which the act of August 2, 1882, relates there can be no need of further appropriations until after the close of the present session. If, however, any action should seem to be necessary in respect to particular objects, it will be entirely feasible to provide for those objects by appropriate legislation. It is possible, for example, that a delay until the assembling of the next Congress to make additional provision for the Mississippi River improvements might be attended with serious consequences. If such should appear to be the case, a just bill relating to that subject would command my approval. This leads me to offer a suggestion which I trust will commend itself to the wisdom of Congress. Is it not advisable that grants of considerable sums of money for diverse and independent schemes of internal improvement should be made the subjects of separate and distinct legislative enactments? It will scarcely be gainsaid, even by those who favor the most liberal expenditures for such purposes as are sought to be accomplished by what is commonly called the river and harbor bill, that the practice of grouping in such a bill appropriations for a great diversity of objects, widely separated either in their nature or in the locality with which they are concerned, or in both, is one which is much to be deprecated unless it is irremediable. It inevitably tends to secure the success of the bill as a whole, though many of the items, if separately considered, could scarcely fail of rejection. By the adoption of the course I have recommended every member of Congress, whenever opportunity should arise for giving his influence and vote for meritorious appropriations, would be enabled so to do without being called upon to sanction others undeserving his approval. So also would the Executive be afforded thereby full opportunity to exercise his constitutional prerogative of opposing whatever appropriations seemed to him objectionable without imperiling the success of others which commended themselves to his judgment. It may be urged in opposition to these suggestions that the number of works of internal improvement which are justly entitled to governmental aid is so great as to render impracticable separate appropriation bills therefor, or even for such comparatively limited number as make disposition of large sums of money. This objection may be well founded, and, whether it be or not, the advantages which would be likely to ensue from the adoption of the course I have recommended may perhaps be more effectually attained by another, which I respectfully submit to Congress as an alternative proposition. It is provided by the constitutions of fourteen of our States that the executive may disapprove any item or items of a bill appropriating money, whereupon the part of the bill approved shall be law and the part disapproved shall fail to become law unless repassed according to the provisions prescribed for the passage of bills over the veto of the executive. The States wherein some such provision as the foregoing is a part of the fundamental law are Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia. I commend to your careful consideration the question whether an amendment of the Federal Constitution in the particular indicated would not afford the best remedy for what is often a grave embrassment both to members of Congress and to the Executive, and is sometimes a serious public mischief. The report of the Secretary of the Navy states the movements of the various squadrons during the year, in home and foreign waters, where our officers and seamen, with such ships as we possess, have continued to illustrate the high character and excellent discipline of the naval organization. On the 21st of December, 1881, information was received that the exploring steamer Jeannette had been crushed and abandoned in the Arctic Ocean. The officers and crew, after a journey over the ice, embarked in three boats for the coast of Siberia. One of the parties, under the command of Chief Engineer George W. Melville, reached the land, and, falling in with the natives, was saved. Another, under Lieutenant-Commander De Long, landed in a barren region near the mouth of the Lena River. After six weeks had elapsed all but two of the number had died from fatigue and starvation. No tidings have been received from the party in the third boat, under the command of Lieutenant Chipp, but a long and fruitless investigation leaves little doubt that all its members perished at sea. As a slight tribute to their heroism I give in this communication the names of the gallant men who sacrificed their lives on this expedition: Lieutenant-Commander George W. De Long, Surgeon James M. Ambler, Jerome J. Collins, Hans Halmer Erichsen, Heinrich H. Kaacke, George W. Boyd, Walter Lee, Adolph Dressier, Carl A. Gortz, Nelse Iverson, the cook Ah Sam, and the Indian Alexy. The officers and men in the missing boat were Lieutenant Charles W. Chipp, commanding; William Dunbar, Alfred Sweetman, Waiter Sharvell, Albert C. Kuehne, Edward Star, Henry D. Warren, and Peter E. Johnson. Lieutenant Giles B. Harber and Master Willliam H. Scheutze are now bringing home the remains of Lieutenant De Long and his comrades, in pursuance of the directions of Congress. The Rodgers, fitted out for the releif of the Jeannette in accordance with the act of Congress of March 3, 1881, sailed from San Francisco June 16 under the command of Lieutenant Robert M. Berry. On November 30 she was accidentally destroyed by fire while in winter quarters in St. Lawrence Bay, but the officers and crew succeeded in escaping to the shore. Lieutenant Berry and one of his officers, after making a search for the Jeannette along the coast of Siberia, fell in with Chief Engineer Melville's party and returned home by way of Europe. The other officers and the crew of the Rodgers were brought from St. Lawrence Bay by the whaling steamer North Star. Master Charles F. Putnam, who had been placed in charge of a depot of supplies at Cape Serdze, returning to his post from St. Lawrence Bay across the ice in a blinding snow storm, was carried out to sea and lost, notwithstanding all efforts to rescue him. It appears by the Secretary's report that the available naval force of the United States consists of 37 cruisers, 14 single-turreted monitors, built during the rebellion, a large number of smoothbore guns and Parrott rifles, and 87 rifled cannon. The cruising vessels should be gradually replaced by iron or steel ships, the monitors by modern armored vessels, and the armament by high-power rifled guns. The reconstruction of our Navy, which was recommended in my last message, was begun by Congress authorizing, in its recent act, the construction of two large unarmored steel vessels of the character recommended by the late Naval Advisory Board, and subject to the final approval of a new advisory board to be organized as provided by that act. I call your attention to the recommendation of the Secretary and the board that authority be given to construct two more cruisers of smaller dimensions and one fleet dispatch vessel, and that appropriations be made for high-power rifled cannon for the torpedo service and for other harbor defenses. Pending the consideration by Congress of the policy to be hereafter adopted in conducting the eight large navy-yards and their expensive establishments, the Secretary advocates the reduction of expenditures therefor to the lowest possible amounts. For the purpose of affording the officers and seamen of the Navy opportunities for exercise and discipline in their profession, under appropriate control and direction, the Secretary advises that the Light-House Service and Coast Survey be transferred, as now organized, from the Treasury to the Navy Department; and he also suggests, for the reasons which he assigns, that a similar transfer may wisely be made of the cruising revenue vessels. The Secretary forcibly depicts the intimate connection and interdependence of the Navy and the commercial marine, and invites attention to the continued decadence of the latter and the corresponding transfer of our growing commerce to foreign bottoms. This subject is one of the utmost importance to the national welfare. Methods of reviving American shipbuilding and of restoring the United States flag in the ocean carrying trade should receive the immediate attention of Congress. We have mechanical skill and abundant material for the manufacture of modern iron steamships in fair competition with our commercial rivals. Our disadvantage in building ships is the greater cost of labor, and in sailing them, higher taxes, and greater interest on capital, while the ocean highways are already monopolized by our formidable competitors. These obstacles should in some way be overcome, and for our rapid communication with foreign lands we should not continue to depend wholly upon vessels built in the yards of other countries and sailing under foreign flags. With no United States steamers on the principal ocean lines or in any foreign ports, our facilities for extending our commerce are greatly restricted, while the nations which build and sail the ships and carry the mails and passengers obtain thereby conspicuous advantages in increasing their trade. The report of the Postmaster-General gives evidence of the satisfactory condition of that Department and contains many valuable data and accompanying suggestions which can not fail to be of interest. The information which it affords that the receipts for the fiscal year have exceeded the expenditures must be very gratifying to Congress and to the people of the country. As matters which may fairly claim particular attention, I refer you to his observations in reference to the advisability of changing the present basis for fixing salaries and allowances, of extending the money-order system, and of enlarging the functions of the postal establishment so as to put under its control the telegraph system of the country, though from this last and most important recommendation I must withhold my concurrence. At the last session of Congress several bills were introduced into the House of Representatives for the reduction of letter postage to the rate of 2 cents per half ounce. I have given much study and reflection to this subject, and am thoroughly persuaded that such a reduction would be for the best interests of the public. It has been the policy of the Government from its foundation to defray as far as possible the expenses of carrying the mails by a direct tax in the form of postage. It has never been claimed, however, that this service ought to be productive of a net revenue. As has been stated already, the report of the Postmaster-General shows that there is now a very considerable surplus in his Department and that henceforth the receipts are likely to increase at a much greater ratio than the necessary expenditures. Unless some change is made in the existing laws, the profits of the postal service will in a very few years swell the revenues of the Government many millions of dollars. The time seems auspicious, therefore, for some reduction in the rates of postage. In what shall that reduction consist? A review of the legislation which has been had upon this subject during the last thirty years discloses that domestic letters constitute the only class of mail matter which has never been favored by a substantial reduction of rates. I am convinced that the burden of maintaining the service falls most unequally upon that class, and that more than any other it is entitled to present relief. That such relief may be extended without detriment to other public interests wilt be discovered upon reviewing the results of former reductions. Immediately prior to the act of 1845 the postage upon a letter composed of a single sheet was as follows: If conveyed Cents 30 miles or less 6 Between 30 and 80 miles 10 Between 80 and 150 miles 12 1/2 Between 150 and 400 miles 18 3/4 Over 400 miles be: ( 1 the act of 1845 the postage upon a single letter conveyed for any distance under 300 miles was fixed at 5 cents and for any greater distance at 10 cents. By the act of 1851 it was provided that a single letter, if prepaid, should be carried any distance not exceeding 3,000 miles for 3 cents and any greater distance for 6 cents. It will be noticed that both of these reductions were of a radical character and relatively quite as important as that which is now proposed. In each case there ensued a temporary loss of revenue, but a sudden and large influx of business, which substantially repaired that loss within three years. Unless the experience of past legislation in this country and elsewhere goes for naught, it may be safely predicted that the stimulus of 33 1/3 per cent reduction in the tax for carriage would at once increase the number of letters consigned to the mails. The advantages of secrecy would lead to a very general substitution of sealed packets for postal cards and open circulars, and in divers other ways the volume of first class matter would be enormously augmented. Such increase amounted in England, in the first year after the adoption of penny postage, to more than 125 per cent. As a result of careful estimates, the details of which can not be here set out, I have become convinced that the deficiency for the first year after the proposed reduction would not exceed 7 per cent of the expenditures, or $ 3,000,000, while the deficiency after the reduction of 1845 was more than 14 per cent, and after that of 1851 was 27 per cent. Another interesting comparison is afforded by statistics furnished me by the Post-Office Department. The act of 1845 was passed in face of the fact that there existed a deficiency of more than $ 30,000. That of 1851 was encouraged by the slight surplus of $ 132,000. The excess of revenue in the next fiscal year is likely to be $ 3,500,000. If Congress should approve these suggestions, it may be deemed desirable to supply to some extent the deficiency which must for a time result by increasing the charge for carrying merchandise, which is now only 16 cents per pound; but even without such an increase I am confident that the receipts under the diminished rates would equal the expenditures after the lapse of three or four years. The report of the Department of Justice brings anew to your notice the necessity of enlarging the present system of Federal jurisprudence so as effectually to answer the requirements of the ever-increasing litigation with which it is called upon to deal. The Attorney-General renews the suggestions of his predecessor that in the interests of justice better provision than the existing laws afford should be made in certain judicial districts for fixing the fees of witnesses and jurors. In my message of December last I referred to pending criminal proceedings growing out of alleged frauds in what is known as the star-route service of the Post-Office Department, and advised you that I had enjoined upon the Attorney-General and associate counsel, to whom the interests of the Government were intrusted, the duty of prosecuting with the utmost vigor of the law all persons who might be found chargeable with those offenses. A trial of one of these cases has since occurred. It occupied for many weeks the attention of the supreme court of this District and was conducted with great zeal and ability. It resulted in a disagreement of the jury, but the cause has been again placed upon the calendar and will shortly be retried. If any guilty persons shall finally escape punishment for their offenses, it will not be for lack of diligent and earnest efforts on the part of the prosecution. I trust that some agreement may be reached which will speedily enable Congress, with the concurrence of the Executive, to afford the commercial community the benefits of a national bankrupt law. The report of the Secretary of the Interior, with its accompanying documents, presents a full statement of the varied operations of that Department. In respect to Indian affairs nothing has occurred which has changed or seriously modified the views to which I devoted much space in a former communication to Congress. I renew the recommendations therein contained as to extending to the Indian the protection of the law, allotting land in severalty to such as desire it, and making suitable provision for the education of youth. Such provision, as the Secretary forcibly maintains, will prove unavailing unless it is broad enough to include all those who are able and willing to make use of it, and should not solely relate to intellectual training, but also to instruction in such manual labor and simple industrial arts as can be made practically available. Among other important subjects which are included within the Secretary's report, and which will doubtless furnish occasion for Congressional action, may be mentioned the neglect of the railroad companies to which large grants of land were made by the acts of 1862 and 1864 to take title thereto, and their consequent inequitable exemption from local taxation. No survey of our material condition can fail to suggest inquiries as to the moral and intellectual progress of the people. The census returns disclose an alarming state of illiteracy in certain portions of the country, where the provision for schools is grossly inadequate. It is a momentous question for the decision of Congress whether immediate and substantial aid should not be extended by the General Government for supplementing the efforts of private beneficence and of State and Territorial legislation in behalf of education. The regulation of interstate commerce has already been the subject of your deliberations. One of the incidents of the marvelous extension of the railway system of the country has been the adoption of such measures by the corporations which own or control the roads as have tended to impair the advantages of healthful competition and to make hurtful discriminations in the adjustment of freightage. These inequalities have been corrected in several of the States by appropriate legislation, the effect of which is necessarily restricted to the limits of their own territory. So far as such mischiefs affect commerce between the States or between any one of the States and a foreign country, they are subjects of national concern, and Congress alone can afford relief. The results which have thus far attended the enforcement of the recent statute for the suppression of polygamy in the Territories are reported by the Secretary of the Interior. It is not probable that any additional legislation in this regard will be deemed desirable until the effect of existing laws shall be more closely observed and studied. I congratulate you that the commissioners under whose supervision those laws have been put in operation are encouraged to believe that the evil at which they are aimed may be suppressed without resort to such radical measures as in some quarters have been thought indispensable for success. The close relation of the General Government to the Territories preparing to be great States may well engage your special attention. It is there that the Indian disturbances mainly occur and that polygamy has found room for its growth. I can not doubt that a careful survey of Territorial legislation would be of the highest utility. Life and property would become more secure. The liability of outbreaks between Indians and whites would be lessened. The public domain would be more securely guarded and better progress be made in the instruction of the young. Alaska is still without any form of civil government. If means were provided for the education of its people and for the protection of their lives and property, the immense resources of the region would invite permanent settlements and open new fields for industry and enterprise. The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture presents an account of the labors of that Department during the past year and includes information of much interest to the general public. The condition of the forests of the country and the wasteful manner in which their destruction is taking place give cause for serious apprehension. Their action in protecting the earth's surface, in modifying the extremes of climate, and in regulating and sustaining the flow of springs and streams is now well understood, and their importance in relation to the growth and prosperity of the country can not be safely disregarded. They are fast disappearing before destructive fires and the legitimate requirements of our increasing population, and their total extinction can not be long delayed unless better methods than now prevail shall be adopted for their protection and cultivation. The attention of Congress is invited to the necessity of additional legislation to secure the preservation of the valuable forests still remaining on the public domain, especially in the extreme Western States and Territories, where the necessity for their preservation is greater than in less mountainous regions, and where the prevailing dryness of the climate renders their restoration, if they are once destroyed, well nigh impossible. The communication which I made to Congress at its first session, in December last, contained a somewhat full statement of my sentiments in relation to the principles and rules which ought to govern appointments to public service. Referring to the various plans which had theretofore been the subject of discussion in the National Legislature ( plans which in the main were modeled upon the system which obtains in Great Britain, but which lacked certain of the prominent features whereby that system is distinguished ), I felt bound to intimate my doubts whether they, or any of them, would afford adequate remedy for the evils which they aimed to correct. I declared, nevertheless, that if the proposed measures should prove acceptable to Congress they would receive the unhesitating support of the Executive. Since these suggestions were submitted for your consideration there has been no legislation upon the subject to which they relate, but there has meanwhile been an increase in the public interest in that subject, and the people of the country, apparently without distinction of party, have in various ways and upon frequent occasions given expression to their earnest wish for prompt and definite action. In my judgment such action should no longer be postponed. I may add that my own sense of its pressing importance has been quickened by observation of a practical phase of the matter, to which attention has more than once been called by my predecessors. The civil list now comprises about 100,000 persons, far the larger part of whom must, under the terms of the Constitution, he selected by the President either directly or through his own appointees. In the early years of the administration of the Government the personal direction of appointments to the civil service may not have been an irksome task for the Executive, but now that the burden has increased fully a hundredfold it has become greater thin he ought to bear, and it necessarily diverts his time and attention from the proper discharge of other duties no less delicate and responsible, and which in the very nature of things can not be delegated to other hands. In the judgment of not a few who have given study and reflection to this matter, the nation has outgrown the provisions which the Constitution has established for filling the minor offices in the public service. But whatever may be thought of the wisdom or expediency of changing the fundamental law in this regard, it is certain that much relief may be afforded, not only to the President and to the heads of the Departments, but to Senators and Representatives in Congress, by discreet legislation. They would be protected in a great measure by the bill now pending before the Senate, or by any other which should embody its important features, from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor of examining conflicting claims and pretensions of candidates. I trust that before the close of the present session some decisive action may be taken for the correction of the evils which inhere in the present methods of appointment, and I assure you of my hearty cooperation in any measures which are likely to conduce to that end. As to the most appropriate term and tenure of the official life of the subordinate employees of the Government, it seems to be generally agreed that, whatever their extent or character, the one should be definite and the other stable, and that neither should be regulated by zeal in the service of party or fidelity to the fortunes of an individual. It matters little to the people at large what competent person is at the head of this department or of that bureau if they feel assured that the removal of one and the accession of another will not involve the retirement of honest and faithful subordinates whose duties are purely administrative and have no legitimate connection with the triumph of any political principles or the success of any political party or faction. It is to this latter class of officers that the Senate bill, to which I have already referred, exclusively applies. While neither that bill nor any other prominent scheme for improving the civil service concerns the higher grade of officials, who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, I feel bound to correct a prevalent misapprehension as to the frequency with which the present Executive has displaced the incumbent of an office and appointed another in his stead. It has been repeatedly alleged that he has in this particular signally departed from the course which has been pursued under recent Administrations of the Government. The facts are as follows: The whole number of Executive appointments during the four years immediately preceding Mr. Garfield's accession to the Presidency was 2,696. Of this number 244, or 9 per cent, involved the removal of previous incumbents. The ratio of removals to the whole number of appointments was much the same during each of those four years. In the first year, with 790 appointments, there were 74 removals, or 9.3 per cent; in the second, with 917 appointments, there were 85 removals, or 8.5 per cent; in the third, with 480 appointments, there were 48 removals, or 10 per cent; in the fourth, with 429 appointments, there were 37 removals, or 8.6 per cent. In the four months of President Garfield's Administration there were 390 appointments and 89 removals, or 22.7 per cent. Precisely the same number of removals ( 89 ) has taken place in the fourteen months which have since elapsed, but they constitute only 7.8 per cent of the whole number of appointments ( 1,11MADISON. By within that period and less than 2.6 of the entire list of officials ( 3,459 ), exclusive of the Army and Navy, which is filled by Presidential appointment. I declare my approval of such legislation as may be found necessary for supplementing the existing provisions of law in relation to political assessments. In July last I authorized a public announcement that employees of the Government should regard themselves as at liberty to exercise their pleasure in making or refusing to make political contributions, and that their action in that regard would in no manner affect their official status. In this announcement I acted upon the view, which I had always maintained and still maintain, that a public officer should be as absolutely free as any other citizen to give or to withhold a contribution for the aid of the political party of his choice. It has, however, been urged, and doubtless not without foundation in fact, that by solicitation of official superiors and by other modes such contributions have at times been obtained from persons whose only motive for giving has been the fear of what might befall them if they refused. It goes without saying that such contributions are not voluntary, and in my judgment their collection should be prohibited by law. A bill which will effectually suppress them will receive my cordial approval. I hope that, however numerous and urgent may be the demands upon your attention, the interests of this District will not be forgotten. The denial to its residents of the great right of suffrage in all its relations to national, State, and municipal action imposes upon Congress the duty of affording them the best administration which its wisdom can devise. The report of the District Commissioners indicates certain measures whose adoption would seem to be very desirable. 1 instance in particular those which relate to arrears of taxes, to steam railroads, and to assessments of real property. Among the questions which have been the topic of recent debate in the halls of Congress none are of greater gravity than those relating to the ascertainment of the vote for Presidential electors and the intendment of the Constitution in its provisions for devolving Executive functions upon the Vice-President when the President suffers from inability to discharge the powers and duties of his office. I trust that no embarrassments may result from a failure to determine these questions before another national election. The closing year has been replete with blessings, for which we owe to the Giver of All Good our reverent acknowledgment. For the uninterrupted harmony of our foreign relations, for the decay of sectional animosities, for the exuberance of our harvests and the triumphs of our mining and manufacturing industries, for the prevalence of health, the spread of intelligence, and the conservation of the public credit, for the growth of the country in all the elements of national greatness -for these and countless other blessings we should rejoice and be glad. I trust that under the inspiration of this great prosperity our counsels may be harmonious, and that the dictates of prudence, patriotism, justice, and economy may lead to the adoption of measures in which the Congress and the Executive may heartily unite\",\n          \"Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: The interest with which the people of the Republic anticipate the assembling of Congress and the fulfillment on that occasion of the duty imposed upon a new President is one of the best evidences of their capacity to realize the hopes of the founders of a political system at once complex and symmetrical. While the different branches of the Government are to a certain extent independent of each other, the duties of all alike have direct reference to the source of power. Fortunately, under this system no man is so high and none so humble in the scale of public station as to escape from the scrutiny or to be exempt from the responsibility which all official functions imply. Upon the justice and intelligence of the masses, in a government thus organized, is the sole reliance of the confederacy and the only security for honest and earnest devotion to its interests against the usurpations and encroachment of power on the one hand and the assaults of personal ambition on the other. The interest of which I have spoken is inseparable from an inquiring, self governing community, but stimulated, doubtless, at the present time by the unsettled condition of our relations with several foreign powers, by the new obligations resulting from a sudden extension of the field of enterprise, by the spirit with which that field has been entered and the amazing energy with which its resources for meeting the demands of humanity have been developed. Although disease, assuming at one time the characteristics of a widespread and devastating pestilence, has left its sad traces upon some portions of our country, we have still the most abundant cause for reverent thankfulness to God for an accumulation of signal mercies showered upon us as a nation. It is well that a consciousness of rapid advancement and increasing strength be habitually associated with an abiding sense of dependence upon Him who holds in His hands the destiny of men and of nations. Recognizing the wisdom of the broad principle of absolute religious toleration proclaimed in our fundamental law, and rejoicing in the benign influence which it has exerted upon our social and political condition, I should shrink from a clear duty did I fail to express my deepest conviction that we can place no secure reliance upon any apparent progress if it be not sustained by national integrity, resting upon the great truths affirmed and illustrated by divine revelation. In the midst of our sorrow for the afflicted and suffering, it has been consoling to see how promptly disaster made true neighbors of districts and cities separated widely from each other, and cheering to watch the strength of that common bond of brotherhood which unites all hearts, in all parts of this Union, when danger threatens from abroad or calamity impends over us at home. Our diplomatic relations with foreign powers have undergone no essential changesince the adjournment of the last Congress. With some of them questions of a disturbing character are still pending, but there are good reasons to believe that these may all be amicably adjusted. For some years past Great Britain has so construed the first article of the convention of the 20th of April, 1818, in regard to the fisheries on the northeastern coast, as to exclude our citizens from some of the fishing grounds to which they freely resorted for nearly a quarter of a century subsequent to the date of that treaty. The United States have never acquiesced in this construction, but have always claimed for their fishermen all the rights which they had so long enjoyed without molestation. With a view to remove all difficulties on the subject, to extend the rights of our fishermen beyond the limits fixed by the convention of 1818, and to regulate trade between the United States and the British North American Provinces, a negotiation has been opened with a fair prospect of a favorable result. To protect our fishermen in the enjoyment of their rights and prevent collision between them and British fishermen, I deemed it expedient to station a naval force in that quarter during the fishing season. Embarrassing questions have also arisen between the two Governments in regard to Central America. Great Britain has proposed to settle them by an amicable arrangement, and our minister at London is instructed to enter into negotiations on that subject. A commission for adjusting the claims of our citizens against Great Britain and those of British subjects against the United States, organized under the convention of the 8th of February last, is now sitting in London for the transaction of business. It is in many respects desirable that the boundary line between the United States and the British Provinces in the northwest, as designated in the convention of the 15th of June, 1846, and especially that part which separates the Territory of Washington from the British possessions on the north, should be traced and marked. I therefore present the subject to your notice. With France our relations continue on the most friendly footing. The extensive commerce between the United States and that country might, it is conceived, be released from some unnecessary restrictions to the mutual advantage of both parties. With a view to this object, some progress has been made in negotiating a treaty of commerce and navigation. Independently of our valuable trade with Spain, we have important political relations with her growing out of our neighborhood to the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico. I am happy to announce that since the last Congress no attempts have been made by unauthorized expeditions within the United States against either of those colonies. Should any movement be manifested within our limits, all the means at my command will be vigorously exerted to repress it. Several annoying occurrences have taken place at Havana, or in the vicinity of the island of Cuba, between our citizens and the Spanish authorities. Considering the proximity of that island to our shores, lying, as it does, in the track of trade between some of our principal cities, and the suspicious vigilance with which foreign intercourse, particularly that with the United States, is there guarded, a repetition of such occurrences may well be apprehended. As no diplomatic intercourse is allowed between our consul at Havana and the Captain-General of Cuba, ready explanations can not be made or prompt redress afforded where injury has resulted. All complaint on the part of our citizens under the present arrangement must be, in the first place, presented to this Government and then referred to Spain. Spain again refers it to her local authorities in Cuba for investigation, and postpones an answer till she has heard from those authorities. To avoid these irritating and vexatious delays, a proposition has been made to provide for a direct appeal for redress to the Captain-General by our consul in behalf of our injured fellow citizens. Hitherto the Government of Spain has declined to enter into any such arrangement. This course on her part is deeply regretted, for without some arrangement of this kind the good understanding between the two countries may be exposed to occasional interruption. Our minister at Madrid is instructed to renew the proposition and to press it again upon the consideration of Her Catholic Majesty's Government. For several years Spain has been calling the attention of this Government to a claim for losses by some of her subjects in the case of the schooner Amistad. This claim is believed to rest on the obligations imposed by our existing treaty with that country. Its justice was admitted in our diplomatic correspondence with the Spanish Government as early as March, 1847, and one of my predecessors, in his annual message of that year, recommended that provision should be made for its payment. In January last it was again submitted to Congress by the Executive. It has received a favorable consideration by committees of both branches, but as yet there has been no final action upon it. I conceive that good faith requires its prompt adjustment, and I present it to your early and favorable consideration. Martin Koszta, a Hungarian by birth, came to this country in 1850, and declared his intention in due form of law to become a citizen of the United States. After remaining here nearly two years he visited Turkey. While at Smyrna he was forcibly seized, taken on board an Austrian brig of war then lying in the harbor of that place, and there confined in irons, with the avowed design to take him into the dominions of Austria. Our consul at Smyrna and legation at Constantinople interposed for his release, but their efforts were ineffectual. While thus in prison Commander Ingraham, with the United States ship of war St. Louis, arrived at Smyrna, and after inquiring into the circumstances of the case came to the conclusion that Koszta was entitled to the protection of this Government, and took energetic and prompt measures for his release. Under an arrangement between the agents of the United States and of Austria, he was transferred to the custody of the French support at Smyrna, there to remain until he should be disposed of by the mutual agreement of the consuls of the respective Governments at that place. Pursuant to that agreement, he has been released, and is now in the United States. The Emperor of Austria has made the conduct of our officers who took part in this transaction a subject of grave complaint. Regarding Koszta as still his subject, and claiming a right to seize him within the limits of the Turkish Empire, he has demanded of this Government its consent to the surrender of the prisoner, a disavowal of the acts of its agents, and satisfaction for the alleged outrage. After a careful consideration of the case I came to the conclusion that Koszta was seized without legal authority at Smyrna; that he was wrongfully detained on board of the Austrian brig of war; that at the time of his seizure he was clothed with the nationality of the United States, and that the acts of our officers, under the circumstances of the case, were justifiable, and their conduct has been fully approved by me, and a compliance with the several demands of the Emperor of Austria has been declined. For a more full account of this transaction and my views in regard to it I refer to the correspondence between the charge d'affaires of Austria and the Secretary of State, which is herewith transmitted. The principles and policy therein maintained on the part of the United States will, whenever a proper occasion occurs, be applied and enforced. The condition of China at this time renders it probable that some important changes will occur in that vast Empire which will lead to a more unrestricted intercourse with it. The commissioner to that country who has been recently appointed is instructed to avail himself of all occasions to open and extend our commercial relations, not only with the Empire of China, but with other Asiatic nations. In 1852 an expedition was sent to Japan, under the command of Commodore Perry, for the purpose of opening commercial intercourse with that Empire. Intelligence has been received of his arrival there and of his having made known to the Emperor of Japan the object of his visit. But it is not yet ascertained how far the Emperor will be disposed to abandon his restrictive policy and open that populous country to a commercial intercourse with the United States. It has been my earnest desire to maintain friendly intercourse with the Governments upon this continent and to aid them in preserving good understanding among themselves. With Mexico a dispute has arisen as to the true boundary line between our Territory of New Mexico and the Mexican State of Chihuahua. A former commissioner of the United States, employed in running that line pursuant to the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, made a serious mistake in determining the initial point on the Rio Grande; but inasmuch as his decision was clearly a departure from the directions for tracing the boundary contained in that treaty, and was not concurred in by the surveyor appointed on the part of the United States, whose concurrence was necessary to give validity to that decision, this Government is not concluded thereby; but that of Mexico takes a different view of the subject. There are also other questions of considerable magnitude pending between the two Republics. Our minister in Mexico has ample instructions to adjust them. Negotiations have been opened, but sufficient progress has not been made therein to enable me to speak of the probable result. Impressed with the importance of maintaining amicable relations with that Republic and of yielding with liberality to all her just claims, it is reasonable to expect that an arrangement mutually satisfactory to both countries may be concluded and a lasting friendship between them confirmed and perpetuated. Congress having provided for a full mission to the States of Central America, a minister was sent thither in July last. As yet he has had time to visit only one of these States ( Nicaragua ), where he was received in the most friendly manner. It is hoped that his presence and good offices will have a benign effect in composing the dissensions which prevail among them, and in establishing still more intimate and friendly relations between them respectively and between each of them and the United States. Considering the vast regions of this continent and the number of states which would be made accessible by the free navigation of the river Amazon, particular attention has been given to this subject. Brazil, through whose territories it passes into the ocean, has hitherto persisted in a policy so restricted in regard to the use of this river as to obstruct and nearly exclude foreign commercial intercourse with the States which lie upon its tributaries and upper branches. Our minister to that country is instructed to obtain a relaxation of that policy and to use his efforts to induce the Brazilian Government to open to common use, under proper safeguards, this great natural highway for international trade. Several of the South American States are deeply interested in this attempt to secure the free navigation of the Amazon, and it is reasonable to expect their cooperation in the measure. As the advantages of free commercial intercourse among nations are better understood, more liberal views are generally entertained as to the common rights of all to the free use of those means which nature has provided for international communication. To these more liberal and enlightened views it is hoped that Brazil will conform her policy and remove all unnecessary restrictions upon the free use of a river which traverses so many states and so large a part of the continent. I am happy to inform you that the Republic of Paraguay and the Argentine Confederation have yielded to the liberal policy still resisted by Brazil in regard to the navigable rivers within their respective territories. Treaties embracing this subject, among others, have been negotiated with these Governments, which will be submitted to the Senate at the present session. A new branch of commerce, important to the agricultural interests of the United States, has within a few years past been opened with Peru. Notwithstanding the inexhaustible deposits of guano upon the islands of that country, considerable difficulties are experienced in obtaining the requisite supply. Measures have been taken to remove these difficulties and to secure a more abundant importation of the article. Unfortunately, there has been a serious collision between our citizens who have resorted to the Chincha Islands for it and the Peruvian authorities stationed there. Redress for the outrages committed by the latter was promptly demanded by our minister at Lima. This subject is now under consideration, and there is reason to believe that Peru is disposed to offer adequate indemnity to the aggrieved parties. We are thus not only at peace with all foreign countries, but, in regard to political affairs, are exempt from any cause of serious disquietude in our domestic relations. The controversies which have agitated the country heretofore are passing away with the causes which produced them and the passions which they had awakened; or, if any trace of them remains, it may be reasonably hoped that it will only be perceived in the zealous rivalry of all good citizens to testify their respect for the rights of the States, their devotion to the Union, and their common determination that each one of the States, its institutions, its welfare, and its domestic peace, shall be held alike secure under the sacred aegis of the Constitution. This new league of amity and of mutual confidence and support into which the people of the Republic have entered happily affords inducement and opportunity for the adoption of a more comprehensive and unembarrassed line of policy and action as to the great material interests of the country, whether regarded in themselves or in connection with the powers of the civilized world. The United States have continued gradually and steadily to expand through acquisitions of territory, which, how much soever some of them may have been questioned, are now universally seen and admitted to have been wise in policy, just in character, and a great element in the advancement of our country, and with it of the human race, in freedom, in prosperity, and in happiness. The thirteen States have grown to be thirty one, with relations reaching to Europe on the one side and on the other to the distant realms of Asia. I am deeply sensible of the immense responsibility which the present magnitude of the Republic and the diversity and multiplicity of its interests devolves upon me, the alleviation of which so far as relates to the immediate conduct of the public business, is, first, in my reliance on the wisdom and patriotism of the two Houses of Congress, and, secondly, in the directions afforded me by the principles of public polity affirmed by our fathers of the epoch of 1798, sanctioned by long experience, and consecrated anew by the overwhelming voice of the people of the United States. Recurring to these principles, which constitute the organic basis of union, we perceive that vast as are the functions and the duties of the Federal Government, vested in or intrusted to its three great departments the legislative, executive, and judicial yet the substantive power, the popular force, and the large capacities for social and material development exist in the respective States, which, all being of themselves well constituted republics, as they preceded so they alone are capable of maintaining and perpetuating the American Union. The Federal Government has its appropriate line of action in the specific and limited powers conferred on it by the Constitution, chiefly as to those things in which the States have a common interest in their relations to one another and to foreign governments, while the great mass of interests which belong to cultivated men the ordinary business of life, the springs of industry, all the diversified personal and domestic affairs of society rest securely upon the general reserved powers of the people of the several States. There is the effective democracy of the nation, and there the vital essence of its being and its greatness. Of the practical consequences which flow from the nature of the Federal Government, the primary one is the duty of administering with integrity and fidelity the high trust reposed in it by the Constitution, especially in the application of the public funds as drawn by taxation from the people and appropriated to specific objects by Congress. Happily, I have no occasion to suggest any radical changes in the financial policy of the Government. Ours is almost, if not absolutely, the solitary power of Christendom having a surplus revenue drawn immediately from imposts on commerce, and therefore measured by the spontaneous enterprise and national prosperity of the country, with such indirect relation to agriculture, manufactures, and the products of the earth and sea as to violate no constitutional doctrine and yet vigorously promote the general welfare. Neither as to the sources of the public treasure nor as to the manner of keeping and managing it does any grave controversy now prevail, there being a general acquiescence in the wisdom of the present system. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury will exhibit in detail the state of the public finances and the condition of the various branches of the public service administered by that Department of the Government. The revenue of the country, levied almost insensibly to the taxpayer, goes on from year to year, increasing beyond either the interests or the prospective wants of the Government. At the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1852, there remained in the Treasury a balance of $ 14,632,136. The public revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1853, amounted to $ 58,931,865 from customs and to $ 2,405,708 from public lands and other miscellaneous sources, amounting together to $ 61,337,574, while the public expenditures for the same period, exclusive of payments on account of the public debt, amounted to $ 43,554,262, leaving a balance of $ 32,425,447 of receipts above expenditures. This fact of increasing surplus in the Treasury became the subject of anxious consideration at a very early period of my Administration, and the path of duty in regard to it seemed to me obvious and clear, namely: First, to apply the surplus revenue to the discharge of the public debt so far as it could judiciously be done, and, secondly, to devise means for the gradual reduction of the revenue to the standard of the public exigencies. Of these objects the first has been in the course of accomplishment in a manner and to a degree highly satisfactory. The amount of the public debt of all classes was on the 4th of March, 1853, $ 69,190,037, payments on account of which have been made since that period to the amount of $ 12,703,329, leaving unpaid and in continuous course of liquidation the sum of $ 56,486,708. These payments, although made at the market price of the respective classes of stocks, have been effected readily and to the general advantage of the Treasury, and have at the same time proved of signal utility in the relief they have incidentally afforded to the money market and to the industrial and commercial pursuits of the country. The second of the aftereffect objects, that of the reduction of the tariff, is of great importance, and the plan suggested by the Secretary of the Treasury, which is to reduce the duties on certain articles and to add to the free list many articles now taxed, and especially such as enter into manufactures and are not largely, or at all, produced in the country, is commended to your candid and careful consideration. You will find in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, also, abundant proof of the entire adequacy of the present fiscal system to meet all the requirements of the public service, and that, while properly administered, it operates to the advantage of the community in ordinary business relations. I respectfully ask your attention to sundry suggestions of improvements in the settlement of accounts, especially as regards the large sums of outstanding arrears due to the Government, and of other reforms in the administrative action of his Department which are indicated by the Secretary; as also to the progress made in the construction of marine hospitals, custom houses, and of a new mint in California and assay office in the city of New York, heretofore provided for by Congress, and also to the eminently successful progress of the Coast Survey and of the Light House Board. Among the objects meriting your attention will be important recommendations from the Secretaries of War and Navy. I am fully satisfied that the Navy of the United States is not in a condition of strength and efficiency commensurate with the magnitude of our commercial and other interests, and commend to your especial attention the suggestions on this subject made by the Secretary of the Navy. I respectfully submit that the Army, which under our system must always be regarded with the highest interest as a nucleus around which the volunteer forces of the nation gather in the hour of danger, requires augmentation, or modification, to adapt it to the present extended limits and frontier relations of the country and the condition of the Indian tribes in the interior of the continent, the necessity of which will appear in the communications of the Secretaries of War and the Interior. In the administration of the Post-Office Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1853, the gross expenditure was $ 7,982,756, and the gross receipts during the same period $ 5,942,734, showing that the current revenue failed to meet the current expenses of the Department by the sum of $ 2,042,032. The causes which, under the present postal system and laws, led inevitably to this result are fully explained by the report of the Postmaster-General, one great cause being the enormous rates the Department has been compelled to pay for mail service rendered by railroad companies. The exhibit in the report of the Postmaster-General of the income and expenditures by mail steamers will be found peculiarly interesting and of a character to demand the immediate action of Congress. Numerous and flagrant frauds upon the Pension Bureau have been brought to light within the last year, and in some instances merited punishments inflicted; but, unfortunately, in others guilty parties have escaped, not through the want of sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction, but in consequence of the provisions of limitation in the existing laws. From the nature of these claims, the remoteness of the tribunals to pass upon them, and the mode in which the proof is of necessity furnished, temptations to crime have been greatly stimulated by the obvious difficulties of detection. The defects in the law upon this subject are so apparent and so fatal to the ends of justice that your early action relating to it is most desirable. During the last fiscal year 9,819,411 acres of the public lands have been surveyed and 10,363,891 acres brought into market. Within the same period the sales by public purchase and private entry amounted to 1,083,495 acres; located under military bountys and warrants, 6,142,360 acres; located under other certificates, 9,427 acres; ceded to the States as swamp lands, 16,684,253 acres; selected for railroad and other objects under acts of Congress, 1,427,457 acres: total amount of lands disposed of within the fiscal year, 25,346,992 acres, which is an increase in quantity sold and located under land warrants and grants of 12,231, 818 acres over the fiscal year immediately preceding. The quantity of land sold during the second and third quarters of 1852 was 334,451 acres; the amount received therefor was $ 623,687. The quantity sold the second and third quarters of the year 1853 was 1,609,919 acres, and the amount received therefor $ 2,226,876. The whole number of land warrants issued under existing laws prior to the 30th of September last was 266,042, of which there were outstanding at that date 66,947. The quantity of land required to satisfy these outstanding warrants is 4,778,120 acres. Warrants have been issued to 30th of September last under the act of 11th February, 1847, calling for 12,879,280 acres, under acts of September 28, 1850, and March 22, 1852, calling for 12,505,360 acres, making a total of 25,384,640 acres. It is believed that experience has verified the wisdom and justice of the present system with regard to the public domain in most essential particulars. You will perceive from the report of the Secretary of the Interior that opinions which have often been expressed in relation to the operation of the land system as not being a source of revenue to the Federal Treasury were erroneous. The net profits from the sale of the public lands to June 30, 1853, amounted to the sum of $ 53,289,465. I recommend the extension of the land system over the Territories of Utah and New Mexico, with such modifications as their peculiarities may require. Regarding our public domain as chiefly valuable to provide homes for the industrious and enterprising, I am not prepared to recommend any essential change in the land system, except by modifications in favor of the actual settler and an extension of the preemption principle in certain cases, for reasons and on grounds which will be fully developed in the reports to be laid before you. Congress, representing the proprietors of the territorial domain and charged especially with power to dispose of territory belonging to the United States, has for a long course of years, beginning with the Administration of Mr. Jefferson, exercised the power to construct roads within the Territories, and there are so many and obvious distinctions between this exercise of power and that of making roads within the States that the former has never been considered subject to such objections as apply to the latter; and such may now be considered the settled construction of the power of the Federal Government upon the subject. Numerous applications have been and no doubt will continue to be made for grants of land in aid of the construction of railways. It is not believed to be within the intent and meaning of the Constitution that the power to dispose of the public domain should be used otherwise than might be expected from a prudent proprietor and therefore that grants of land to aid in the construction of roads should be restricted to cases where it would be for the interest of a proprietor under like circumstances thus to contribute to the construction of these works. For the practical operation of such grants thus far in advancing the interests ot the States in which the works are located, and at the same time the substantial interests of all the other States, by enhancing the value and promoting the rapid sale of the public domain, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior. A careful examination, however, will show that this experience is the result of a just discrimination and will be far from affording encouragement to a reckless or indiscriminate extension of the principle. I commend to your favorable consideration the men of genius of our country who by their inventions and discoveries in science and arts have contributed largely to the improvements of the age without, in many instances, securing for themselves anything like an adequate reward. For many interesting details upon this subject I refer you to the appropriate reports, and especially urge upon your early attention the apparently slight, but really important, modifications of existing laws therein suggested. The liberal spirit which has so long marked the action of Congress in relation to the District of Columbia will, I have no doubt, continue to be manifested. The erection of an asylum for the insane of the District of Columbia and of the Army and Navy of the United States has been somewhat retarded by the great demand for materials and labor during the past summer, but full preparation for the reception of patients before the return of another winter is anticipated; and there is the best reason to believe, from the plan and contemplated arrangements which have been devised, with the large experience furnished within the last few years in relation to the nature and treatment of the disease, that it will prove an asylum indeed to this most helpless and afflicted class of sufferers and stand as a noble monument of wisdom and mercy. Under the acts of Congress of August 31, 1852, and of March 3, 1853, designed to secure for the cities of Washington and Georgetown an abundant supply of good and wholesome water, it became my duty to examine the report and plans of the engineer who had charge of the surveys under the act first named. The best, if not the only, plan calculated to secure permanently the object sought was that which contemplates taking the water from the Great Falls of the Potomac, and consequently I gave to it my approval. For the progress and present condition of this important work and for its demands so far as appropriations are concerned I refer you to the report of the Secretary of War. The present judicial system of the United States has now been in operation for so long a period of time and has in its general theory and much of its details become so familiar to the country and acquired so entirely the public confidence that if modified in any respect it should only be in those particulars which may adapt it to the increased extent, population, and legal business of the United States. In this relation the organization of the courts is now confessedly inadequate to the duties to be performed by them, in consequence of which the States of Florida, Wisconsin, Iowa, Texas, and California, and districts of other States, are in effect excluded from the full benefits of the general system by the functions of the circuit court being devolved on the district judges in all those States or parts of States. The spirit of the Constitution and a due regard to justice require that all the States of the Union should be placed on the same footing in regard to the judicial tribunals. I therefore commend to your consideration this important subject, which in my judgment demands the speedy action of Congress. I will present to you, if deemed desirable, a plan which I am prepared to recommend for the enlargement and modification of the present judicial system. The act of Congress establishing the Smithsonian Institution provided that the President of the United States and other persons therein designated should constitute an \\u201cestablishment\\u201d by that name, and that the members should hold stated and special meetings for the supervision of the affairs of the Institution. The organization not having taken place, it seemed to me proper that it should be effected without delay. This has been done; and an occasion was thereby presented for inspecting the condition of the Institution and appreciating its successful progress thus far and its high promise of great and general usefulness. I have omitted to ask your favorable consideration for the estimates of works of a local character in twenty-seven of the thirty one States, amounting to $ 1,754,500, because, independently of the grounds which have so often been urged against the application of the Federal revenue for works of this character, inequality, with consequent injustice, is inherent in the nature of the proposition, and because the plan has proved entirely inadequate to the accomplishment of the objects sought. The subject of internal improvements, claiming alike the interest and good will of all, has, nevertheless, been the basis of much political discussion and has stood as a deep-graven line of division between statesmen of eminent ability and patriotism. The rule of strict construction of all powers delegated by the States to the General Government has arrayed itself from time to time against the rapid progress of expenditures from the National Treasury on works of a local character within the States. Memorable as an epoch in the history of this subject is the message of President Jackson of the 27th of May, 1830, which met the system of internal improvements in its comparative infancy; but so rapid had been its growth that the projected appropriations in that year for works of this character had risen to the alarming amount of more than $ 166,281,505.55 The that message the President admitted the difficulty of bringing back the operations of the Government to the construction of the Constitution set up in 1798, and marked it as an admonitory proof of the necessity of guarding that instrument with sleepless vigilance against the authority of precedents which had not the sanction of its most plainly defined powers. Our Government exists under a written compact between sovereign States, uniting for specific objects and with specific grants to their general agent. If, then, in the progress of its administration there have been departures from the terms and intent of the compact, it is and will ever be proper to refer back to the fixed standard which our fathers left us and to make a stern effort to conform our action to it. It would seem that the fact of a principle having been resisted from the first by many of the wisest and most patriotic men of the Republic, and a policy having provoked constant strife without arriving at a conclusion which can be regarded as satisfactory to its most earnest advocates, should suggest the inquiry whether there may not be a plan likely to be crowned by happier results. Without perceiving any sound distinction or intending to assert any principle as opposed to improvements needed for the protection of internal commerce which does not equally apply to improvements upon the seaboard for the protection of foreign commerce, I submit to you whether it may not be safely anticipated that if the policy were once settled against appropriations by the General Government for local improvements for the benefit of commerce, localities requiring expenditures would not, by modes and means clearly legitimate and proper, raise the fund necessary for such constructions as the safety or other interests of their commerce might require. If that can be regarded as a system which in the experience of mere than thirty years has at no time so commanded the public judgment as to give it the character of a settled policy; which, though it has produced some works of conceded importance, has been attended with an expenditure quite disproportionate to their value and has resulted in squandering large sums upon objects which have answered no valuable purpose, the interests of all the States require it to be abandoned unless hopes may be indulged for the future which find no warrant in the past. With an anxious desire for the completion of the works which are regarded by all good citizens with sincere interest, I have deemed it my duty to ask at your hands a deliberate reconsideration of the question, with a hope that, animated by a desire to promote the permanent and substantial interests of the country, your wisdom may prove equal to the task of devising and maturing a plan which, applied to this subject, may promise something better than constant strife, the suspension of the powers of local enterprise, the exciting of vain hopes, and the disappointment of cherished expectations. In expending the appropriations made by the last Congress several cases have arisen in relation to works for the improvement of harbors which involve questions as to the right of soil and jurisdiction, and have threatened conflict between the authority of the State and General Governments. The right to construct a breakwater, jetty, or dam would seem necessarily to carry with it the power to protect and preserve such constructions. This can only be effectually done by having jurisdiction over the soil. But no clause of the Constitution is found on which to rest the claim of the United States to exercise jurisdiction over the soil of a State except that conferred by the eighth section of the first article of the Constitution. It is, then, submitted whether, in all cases where constructions are to be erected by the General Government, the right of soil should not first be obtained and legislative provision be made to cover all such cases. For the progress made in the construction of roads within the Territories, as provided for in the appropriations of the last Congress, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of War. There is one subject of a domestic nature which, from its intrinsic importance and the many interesting questions of future policy which it involves, can not fail to receive your early attention. I allude to the means of communication by which different parts of the wide expanse of our country are to be placed in closer connection for purposes both of defense and commercial intercourse, and more especially such as appertain to the communication of those great divisions of the Union which lie on the opposite sides of the Rocky Mountains. That the Government has not been unmindful of this heretofore is apparent from the aid it has afforded through appropriations for mail facilities and other purposes. But the general subject will now present itself under aspects more imposing and more purely national by reason of the surveys ordered by Congress, and now in the process of completion, for communication by railway across the continent, and wholly within the limits of the United States. The power to declare war, to raise and support armies, to provide and maintain a navy, and to call forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions was conferred upon Congress as means to provide for the common defense and to protect a territory and a population now widespread and vastly multiplied. As incidental to and indispensable for the exercise of this power, it must sometimes be necessary to construct military roads and protect harbors of refuge. To appropriations by Congress for such objects no sound objection can be raised. Happily for our country, its peaceful policy and rapidly increasing population impose upon us no urgent necessity for preparation, and leave but few trackless deserts between assailable points and a patriotic people ever ready and generally able to protect them. These necessary links the enterprise and energy of our people are steadily and boldly struggling to supply. All experience affirms that wherever private enterprise will avail it is most wise for the General Government to leave to that and individual watchfulness the location and execution of all means of communication. The surveys before alluded to were designed to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the river Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean. Parties are now in the field making explorations, where previous examinations had not supplied sufficient data and where there was the best reason to hope the object sought might be found. The means and time being both limited, it is not to be expected that all the accurate knowledge desired will be obtained, but it is hoped that much and important information will be added to the stock previously possessed, and that partial, if not full, reports of the surveys ordered will be received in time for transmission to the two Houses of Congress on or before the first Monday in February next, as required by the act of appropriation. The magnitude of the enterprise contemplated has aroused and will doubtless continue to excite a very general interest throughout the country. In its political, its commercial, and its military bearings it has varied, great, and increasing claims to consideration. The heavy expense, the great delay, and, at times, fatality attending travel by either of the Isthmus routes have demonstrated the advantage which would result from interterritorial communication by such safe and rapid means as a railroad would supply. These difficulties, which have been encountered in a period of peace, would be magnified and still further increased in time of war. But whilst the embarrassments already encountered and others under new contingencies to be anticipated may serve strikingly to exhibit the importance of such a work, neither these nor all considerations combined can have an appreciable value when weighed against the obligation strictly to adhere to the Constitution and faithfully to execute the powers it confers. Within this limit and to the extent of the interest of the Government involved it would seem both expedient and proper if an economical and practicable route shall be found to aid by all constitutional means in the construction of a road which will unite by speedy transit the populations of the Pacific and Atlantic States. To guard against misconception, it should be remarked that although the power to construct or aid in the construction of a road within the limits of a Territory is not embarrassed by that question of jurisdiction which would arise within the limits of a State, it is, nevertheless, held to be of doubtful power and more than doubtful propriety, even within the limits of a Territory, for the General Government to undertake to administer the affairs of a railroad, a canal, or other similar construction, and therefore that its connection with a work of this character should be incidental rather than primary. I will only add at present that, fully appreciating the magnitude of the subject and solicitous that the Atlantic and Pacific shores of the Republic may be bound together by inseparable ties of common interest, as well as of common fealty and attachment to the Union, I shall be disposed, so far as my own action is concerned, to follow the lights of the Constitution as expounded and illustrated by those whose opinions and expositions constitute the standard of my political faith in regard to the powers of the Federal Government. It is, I trust, not necessary to say that no grandeur of enterprise and no present urgent inducement promising popular favor will lead me to disregard those lights or to depart from that path which experience has proved to be safe, and which is now radiant with the glow of prosperity and legitimate constitutional progress. We can afford to wait, but we can not afford to overlook the ark of our security. It is no part of my purpose to give prominence to any subject which may properly be regarded as set at rest by the deliberate judgment of the people. But while the present is bright with promise and the future full of demand and inducement for the exercise of active intelligence, the past can never be without useful lessons of admonition and instruction. If its dangers serve not as beacons, they will evidently fail to fulfill the object of a wise design. When the grave shall have closed over all who are now endeavoring to meet the obligations of duty, the year 1850 will be recurred to as a period filled with anxious apprehension. A successful war had just terminated. Peace brought with it a vast augmentation of territory. Disturbing questions arose bearing upon the domestic institutions of one portion of the Confederacy and involving the constitutional rights of the States. But notwithstanding differences of opinion and sentiment which then existed in relation to details and specific provisions, the acquiescence of distinguished citizens, whose devotion to the Union can never be doubted, has given renewed vigor to our institutions and restored a sense of repose and security to the public mind throughout the Confederacy. That this repose is to suffer no shock during my official term, if I have power to avert it, those who placed me here may be assured. The wisdom of men who knew what independence cost, who had put all at stake upon the issue of the Revolutionary struggle, disposed of the subject to which I refer in the only way consistent with the Union of these States and with the march of power and prosperity which has made us what we are. It is a significant fact that from the adoption of the Constitution until the officers and soldiers of the Revolution had passed to their graves, or, through the infirmities of age and wounds, had ceased to participate actively in public affairs, there was not merely a quiet acquiescence in, but a prompt vindication of, the constitutional rights of the States. The reserved powers were scrupulously respected. No statesman put forth the narrow views of casuists to justify interference and agitation, but the spirit of the compact was regarded as sacred in the eye of honor and indispensable for the great experiment of civil liberty, which, environed by inherent difficulties, was yet borne forward in apparent weakness by a power superior to all obstacles. There is no condemnation which the voice of freedom will not pronounce upon us should we prove faithless to this great trust. While men inhabiting different parts of this vast continent can no more be expected to hold the same opinions or entertain the same sentiments than every variety of climate or soil can be expected to furnish the same agricultural products, they can unite in a common object and sustain common principles essential to the maintenance of that object. The gallant men of the South and the North could stand together during the struggle of the Revolution; they could stand together in the more trying period which succeeded the clangor of arms. As their united valor was adequate to all the trials of the camp and dangers of the field, so their united wisdom proved equal to the greater task of founding upon a deep and broad basis institutions which it has been our privilege to enjoy and will ever be our most sacred duty to sustain. It is but the feeble expression of a faith strong and universal to say that their sons, whose blood mingled so often upon the same field during the War of 1812 and who have more recently borne in triumph the flag of the country upon a foreign soil, will never permit alienation of feeling to weaken the power of their united efforts nor internal dissensions to paralyze the great arm of freedom, uplifted for the vindication of self government. I have thus briefly presented such suggestions as seem to me especially worthy of your consideration. In providing for the present you can hardly fail to avail yourselves of the light which the experience of the past casts upon the future. The growth of our population has now brought us, in the destined career of our national history, to a point at which it well behooves us to expand our vision over the vast prospective. The successive decennial returns of the census since the adoption of the Constitution have revealed a law of steady, progressive development, which may be stated in general terms as a duplication every quarter century. Carried forward from the point already reached for only a short period of time, as applicable to the existence of a nation, this law of progress, if unchecked, will bring us to almost incredible results. A large allowance for a diminished proportional effect of emigration would not very materially reduce the estimate, while the increased average duration of human life known to have already resulted from the scientific and hygienic improvements of the past fifty years will tend to keep up through the next fifty, or perhaps hundred, the same ratio of growth which has been thus revealed in our past progress; and to the influence of these causes may be added the influx of laboring masses from eastern Asia to the Pacific side of our possessions, together with the probable accession of the populations already existing in other parts of our hemisphere, which within the period in question will feel with yearly increasing force the natural attraction of so vast, powerful, and prosperous a confederation of self governing republics and will seek the privilege of being admitted within its safe and happy bosom, transferring with themselves, by a peaceful and healthy process of incorporation, spacious regions of virgin and exuberant soil, which are destined to swarm with the fast growing and fast-spreading millions of our race. These considerations seem fully to justify the presumption that the law of population above stated will continue to act with undiminished effect through at least the next half century, and that thousands of persons who have already arrived at maturity and are now exercising the rights of freemen will close their eyes on the spectacle of more than 100,000,000 of population embraced within the majestic proportions of the American Union. It is not merely as an interesting topic of speculation that I present these views for your consideration. They have important practical bearings upon all the political duties we are called upon to perform. Heretofore our system of government has worked on what may be termed a miniature scale in comparison with the development which it must thus assume within a future so near at hand as scarcely to be beyond the present of the existing generation. It is evident that a confederation so vast and so varied, both in numbers and in territorial extent, in habits and in interests, could only be kept in national cohesion by the strictest fidelity to the principles of the Constitution as understood by those who have adhered to the most restricted construction of the powers granted by the people and the States. Interpreted and applied according to those principles, the great compact adapts itself with healthy ease and freedom to an unlimited extension of that benign system of federative self government of which it is our glorious and, I trust, immortal charter. Let us, then, with redoubled vigilance, be on our guard against yielding to the temptation of the exercise of doubtful powers, even under the pressure of the motives of conceded temporary advantage and apparent temporary expediency. The minimum of Federal government compatible with the maintenance of national unity and efficient action in our relations with the rest of the world should afford the rule and measure of construction of our powers under the general clauses of the Constitution. A spirit of strict deference to the sovereign rights and dignity of every State, rather than a disposition to subordinate the States into a provincial relation to the central authority, should characterize all our exercise of the respective powers temporarily vested in us as a sacred trust from the generous confidence of our constituents. In like manner, as a manifestly indispensable condition of the perpetuation of the Union and of the realization of that magnificent national future adverted to, does the duty become yearly stronger and clearer upon us, as citizens of the several States, to cultivate a fraternal and affectionate spirit, language, and conduct in regard to other States and in relation to the varied interests, institutions, and habits of sentiment and opinion which may respectively characterize them. Mutual forbearance, respect, and noninterference in our personal action as citizens and an enlarged exercise of the most liberal principles of comity in the public dealings of State with State, whether in legislation or in the execution of laws, are the means to perpetuate that confidence and fraternity the decay of which a mere political union, on so vast a scale, could not long survive. In still another point of view is an important practical duty suggested by this consideration of the magnitude of dimensions to which our political system, with its corresponding machinery of government, is so rapidly expanding. With increased vigilance does it require us to cultivate the cardinal virtues of public frugality and official integrity and purity. Public affairs ought to be so conducted that a settled conviction shall pervade the entire Union that nothing short of the highest tone and standard of public morality marks every part of the administration and legislation of the General Government. Thus will the federal system, whatever expansion time and progress may give it, continue more and more deeply rooted in the love and confidence of the people. That wise economy which is as far removed from parsimony as from corrupt and corrupting extravagance; that single regard for the public good which will frown upon all attempts to approach the Treasury with insidious projects of private interest cloaked under public pretexts; that sound fiscal administration which, in the legislative department, guards against the dangerous temptations incident to overflowing revenue, and, in the executive, maintains an unsleeping watchfulness against the tendency of all national expenditure to extravagance, while they are admitted elementary political duties, may, I trust, be deemed as properly adverted to and urged in view of the more impressive sense of that necessity which is directly suggested by the considerations now presented. Since the adjournment of Congress the Vice-President of the United States has passed from the scenes of earth, without having entered upon the duties of the station to which he had been called by the voice of his countrymen. Having occupied almost continuously for more than thirty years a seat in one or the other of the two Houses of Congress, and having by his singular purity and wisdom secured unbounded confidence and universal respect, his failing health was watched by the nation with painful solicitude. His loss to the country, under all the circumstances, has been justly regarded as irreparable. In compliance with the act of Congress of March 2, 1853, the oath of office was administered to him on the 24th of that month at Ariadne estate, near Matanzas, in the island of Cuba; but his strength gradually declined, and was hardly sufficient to enable him to return to his home in Alabama, where, on the 18th day of April, in the most calm and peaceful way, his long and eminently useful career was terminated. Entertaining unlimited confidence in your intelligent and patriotic devotion to the public interest, and being conscious of no motives on my part which are not inseparable from the honor and advancement of my country, I hope it may be my privilege to deserve and secure not only your cordial cooperation in great public measures, but also those relations of mutual confidence and regard which it is always so desirable to cultivate between members of coordinate branches of the Government\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n
